"","","Goleman, Daniel","Daniel Goleman","#1 BESTSELLER - The groundbreaking book that redefines what it means to be smart, with a new introduction by the author ""A thoughtfully written, persuasive account explaining emotional intelligence and why it can be crucial.""--USA Today Everyone knows that high IQ is no guarantee of success, happiness, or virtue, but until Emotional Intelligence,  we could only guess why. Daniel Goleman's brilliant report from the frontiers of psychology and neuroscience offers startling new insight into our ""two minds""--the rational and the emotional--and how they together shape our destiny. Drawing on groundbreaking brain and behavioral research, Goleman shows the factors at work when people of high IQ flounder and those of modest IQ do surprisingly well. These factors, which include self-awareness, self-discipline, and empathy, add up to a different way of being smart--and they aren't fixed at birth. Although shaped by childhood experiences, emotional intelligence can be nurtured and strengthened throughout our adulthood--with immediate benefits to our health, our relationships, and our work. The twenty-fifth-anniversary edition of Emotional Intelligence could not come at a better time--we spend so much of our time online, more and more jobs are becoming automated and digitized, and our children are picking up new technology faster than we ever imagined. With a new introduction from the author, the twenty-fifth-anniversary edition prepares readers, now more than ever, to reach their fullest potential and stand out from the pack with the help of EI.","","152.4","2021-11-10T22:51:32-08:00","2021-08-04T00:00:00-07:00","Emotions and cognition, Emotions--Social aspects, Emotions, Emotional intelligence, Management--Psychological aspects, Personality development, Success--Psychological aspects, Executive ability","","26329","9780553804911","9780553804911","goodreads:26329,isbn:9780553804911,google:c3PDO7jKTJMC,ltid:208333141,oclc-owi:964683,oclc:32430189,lc_authority_name:n81050835,viaf_author_id:24602077,isni:0000000108792450,lccn:lccn-n81050835,loc_lccn:95016685","","BF561","[Emotional Intelligence](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333141)

As the son of Frey, the god of summer, fertility, and health, Magnus isn't naturally inclined to fighting. But he has strong and steadfast friends, including Hearthstone the elf, Blitzen the dwarf, and Samirah the Valkyrie, and together they have achieved brave deeds, such as defeating Fenris Wolf and battling giants for Thor's hammer, Mjolnir. Now Magnus faces his most dangerous trial yet. His cousin, Annabeth, recruits her boyfriend, Percy Jackson, to give Magnus some pointers, but will his training be enough?  Loki is free from his chains. He's readying *Naglfar* , the Ship of the Dead, complete with a host of giants and zombies, to sail against the Asgardian gods and begin the final battle of Ragnarok. It's up to Magnus and his friends to stop him, but to do so they will have to sail across the oceans of Midgard, Jotunheim, and Niflheim in a desperate race to reach *Naglfar* before it's ready to sail. Along the way, they will face angry sea gods, hostile giants, and an evil fire-breathing dragon. But Magnus's biggest challenge will be facing his own inner demons. Does he have what it takes to outwit the wily trickster god?","","813.6","2021-11-10T22:51:32-08:00","2021-11-05T00:00:00-07:00","Mythology; Norse, Loki (Norse deity), Ships, Adventure stories, Fantasy fiction","","28006120","9781423160939","9781423160939","isbn:9781423160939,google:-kQgvgAACAAJ,ltid:208333136,goodreads:28006120,oclc-owi:3903470683,oclc:960278130,lc_authority_name:no97039491,viaf_author_id:60214017,isni:0000000109066661,lccn:lccn-no97039491","Gómez Calvoˏ Ignacio [Translator; Author], Akhmonˏ YaʻEl [Translator]","PZ7.R4829","[The Ship of the Dead](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333136)

"","","Guillebeau, Chris","Chris Guillebeau","In ***The $100 Startup** , *Chris Guillebeau shows you how to lead of life of adventure, meaning and purpose – *and* earn a good living.  Still in his early thirties, Chris is on the verge of completing a tour of every country on earth – he’s already visited more than 175 nations – and yet he’s never held a “real job” or earned a regular paycheck. Rather, he has a special genius for turning ideas into income, and he uses what he earns both to support his life of adventure and to give back.  There are *many* *others* like Chris – those who’ve found ways to opt out of traditional employment and create the time and income to pursue what they find meaningful. Sometimes, achieving that perfect blend of passion and income doesn’t depend on shelving what you currently do. You can start small with your venture, committing little time or money, and wait to take the real plunge when you're sure it's successful.  In preparing to write this book, Chris identified 1,500 individuals who have built businesses earning $50,000 or more from a modest investment (in many cases, $100 or less), and from that group he’s chosen to focus on the 50 most intriguing case studies. In nearly all cases, people with no special skills discovered aspects of their personal passions that could be monetized, and were able to restructure their lives in ways that gave them greater freedom and fulfillment.  Here, finally, distilled into one easy-to-use guide, are the most valuable lessons from those who’ve learned how to turn what they do into a gateway to self-fulfillment. It’s all about finding the intersection between your “expertise” – even if you don’t consider it such -- and what other people will pay for. You don’t need an MBA, a business plan or even employees. All you need is a product or service that springs from what you love to do anyway, people willing to pay, and a way to get paid.  Not content to talk in generalities, Chris tells you exactly how many dollars his group of unexpected entrepreneurs required to get their projects up and running; what these individuals did in the first weeks and months to generate significant cash; some of the key mistakes they made along the way, and the crucial insights that made the business stick. Among Chris’s key principles: if you’re good at one thing, you’re probably good at something else; never teach a man to fish – *sell* him the fish instead; and in the battle between planning and action, action wins.  In ancient times, people who were dissatisfied with their lives dreamed of finding magic lamps, buried treasure, or streets paved with gold. Today, we know that it’s up to us to change our lives. And the best part is, if we change our *own* life, we can help others change *theirs.* This remarkable book will start you on your way.","","658.11","2021-11-10T22:51:32-08:00","2021-05-12T00:00:00-07:00","New business enterprises--Management, Entrepreneurship, Alternative lifestyles","","12605157","9780307951526","9780307951526","ltid:208333142,goodreads:12605157,isbn:9780307951526,google:2YeBy-RlgkQC,oclc-owi:3375633343,oclc:775590883,lc_authority_name:n2010019965,viaf_author_id:250160122,isni:000000037078873,lccn:lccn-n2010019965","Grootˏ Marike [Translator], Guillebeauˏ Chris [Author; Narrator]","HD62.5","[The $100 Startup: Reinvent the Way You Make a Living, Do What You Love, and Create a New Future](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333142)

Drawing on the latest research in psychology, neuroscience and behavioural economics, she draws an anatomy of the power it holds over us.

Why?   In a world where information refreshes endlessly and the workday feels like a race to react to other people's priorities faster, frazzled and distracted has become our default position. But what if the exhaustion of constant busyness wasn't mandatory? What if you could step off the hamster wheel and start taking control of your time and attention? That's what this book is about.   As creators of Google Ventures' renowned ""design sprint,"" Jake and John have helped hundreds of teams solve important problems by changing how they work. Building on the success of these sprints and their experience designing ubiquitous tech products from Gmail to YouTube, they spent years experimenting with their own habits and routines, looking for ways to help people optimize their energy, focus, and time. Now they've packaged the most effective tactics into a four-step daily framework that anyone can use to systematically design their days. *Make Time* is not a one-size-fits-all formula. Instead, it offers a customizable menu of bite-size tips and strategies that can be tailored to individual habits and lifestyles.   *Make Time* isn't about productivity, or checking off more to-dos. Nor does it propose unrealistic solutions like throwing out your smartphone or swearing off social media. Making time isn't about radically overhauling your lifestyle; it's about making small shifts in your environment to liberate yourself from constant busyness and distraction.

"","","Spier, Guy","Guy Spier","Former Wall Street investment banker and philanthropist Guy Spier reveals how meeting Warren Buffett changed his career—and his life—in The Education of a Value Investor: My Transformative Quest for Wealth, Wisdom, and Enlightenment.A Harvard MBA graduate and a successful hedge fund manager, Guy Spier pursued an opportunity to meet one of America’s wealthiest businessmen—bidding $650,100 with Mohnish Pabrai for the privilege to do so—at a charity lunch. What Warren Buffett shared was more important than market share strategies. He learned principles that put him on the path to becoming a real value investor.In this fascinating inside story, Spier reveals his transformation from a Gordon Gekko wannabe, driven by greed, to a sophisticated investor who enjoys success without selling his soul to the highest bidder. His journey is similar to the thousands that flock to New York’s Financial District every year with their shiny new diplomas, aiming to be King of Wall Street, realizing just in the nick of time that the true King lived 1,500 miles away in Omaha, Nebraska.Inspired by Warren’s activist values, Spier altered his career trajectory, learning some powerful lessons along the way including: why the right mentors and partners are critical to long term success on Wall Street; why a topnotch education can sometimes get in the way of your success; that real learning doesn’t begin until you are on your own; and how the best lessons from Warren Buffett have less to do with investing and more to do with being true to yourself. Spier also reveals some of his own winning investment strategies, detailing deals that were winners but also what he learned from deals that went south.Part memoir, part financial investing advisory, and part how-to guide, Guy Spier takes readers on a ride through Wall Street but more importantly provides those that want to take a different path with the insight, guidance, and inspiration they need to carve out their own definition of success.","","332.6092","2021-11-10T22:51:32-08:00","2021-04-21T00:00:00-07:00","Investment advisors, Investment bankers, Spier; Guy, United States, Investments","","20696027","9781137278814","9781137278814","isbn:9781137278814,ltid:208333120,goodreads:20696027,google:ppZVDwAAQBAJ,oclc-owi:2069318699,oclc:869437529,lc_authority_name:nb2008020953,viaf_author_id:19215566,isni:0000000050800533,lccn:lccn-nb2008020953","","HG4928.5.S65","[The Education of a Value Investor: My Transformative Quest for Wealth, Wisdom, and Enlightenment](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333120)

"","","Vanderkam, Laura","Laura Vanderkam","There are 168 hours in a week. This book is about where the time really goes, and how we can all use it better.  It's an unquestioned truth of modern life: we are starved for time. With the rise of two-income families, extreme jobs, and 24/7 connectivity, life is so frenzied we can barely find time to breathe. We tell ourselves we'd like to read more, get to the gym regularly, try new hobbies, and accomplish all kinds of goals. But then we give up because there just aren't enough hours to do it all. Or else, if we don't make excuses, we make sacrifices. To get ahead at work we spend less time with our spouses. To carve out more family time, we put off getting in shape. To train for a marathon, we cut back on sleep. There has to be a better way-and Laura Vanderkam has found one.  After interviewing dozens of successful, happy people, she realized that they allocate their time differently than most of us. Instead of letting the daily grind crowd out the important stuff, they start by making sure there's time for the important stuff. They focus on what they do best and what only they can do. When plans go wrong and they run out of time, only their lesser priorities suffer.  It's not always easy, but the payoff is enormous. Vanderkam shows that it really is possible to sleep eight hours a night, exercise five days a week, take piano lessons, and write a novel without giving up quality time for work, family, and other things that really matter. The key is to start with a blank slate and to fill up your 168 hours only with things that deserve your time.  Of course, you probably won't read to your children at 2:00 am, or skip a Wednesday morning meeting to go hiking, but you can cut back on how much you watch TV, do laundry, or spend time on other less fulfilling activities. Vanderkam shares creative ways to rearrange your schedule to make room for the things that matter most.  168 Hours is a fun, inspiring, practical guide that will help men and women of any age, lifestyle, or career get the most out of their time and their lives.","","658.4093","2021-11-10T22:51:32-08:00","2021-09-16T00:00:00-07:00","Time management","","7847359","9781591843313","9781591843313","goodreads:7847359,isbn:9781591843313,google:B497NQEACAAJ,ltid:208333127,oclc-owi:4162368448,oclc:457151721,lc_authority_name:n2003116142,viaf_author_id:6776209,isni:000000048518272,lccn:lccn-n2003116142","","HD69.T54","[168 Hours: You Have More Time Than You Think](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333127)

Everything we aspired to for “security,” everything we thought was “safe,” no longer is: College. Employment. Retirement. Government. It’s all crumbling down. In every part of society, the middlemen are being pushed out of the picture. No longer is someone coming to hire you, to invest in your company, to sign you, to pick you. It’s on you to make the most important decision in your life: Choose Yourself.  New tools and economic forces have emerged to make it possible for individuals to create art, make millions of dollars and change the world without “help.” More and more opportunities are rising out of the ashes of the broken system to generate real inward success (personal happiness and health) and outward success (fulfilling work and wealth).  This book will teach you to do just that. With dozens of case studies, interviews and examples–including the author, investor and entrepreneur James Altucher’s own heartbreaking and inspiring story–Choose Yourself illuminates your personal path to building a bright, new world out of the wreckage of the old.","","158.1","2021-11-10T22:51:32-08:00","2021-09-15T00:00:00-07:00","Self-actualization (Psychology), Self-realization, Success","","17977529","9781619610224","9781619610224","ltid:208333115,isbn:9781619610224,goodreads:17977529,oclc-owi:4429787572,oclc:851390455,lc_authority_name:n2003113927,viaf_author_id:79562820,isni:0000000056229665,lccn:lccn-n2003113927","","BF637.S4","[Choose Yourself: Be Happy, Make Millions, Live the Dream](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333115)

"","","Shah, Sonia","Sonia Shah","Finalist for the Los Angeles Times Book Prize | A New York Times Editor's Choice“[A] grounded, bracingly intelligent study” —NaturePrizewinning science journalist Sonia Shah presents a startling examination of the pandemics that have ravaged humanity—and shows us how history can prepare us to confront the most serious acute global health emergency of our time. Over the past fifty years, more than three hundred infectious diseases have either emerged or reemerged, appearing in places where they’ve never before been seen. Years before the sudden arrival of COVID-19, ninety percent of epidemiologists predicted that one of them would cause a deadly pandemic sometime in the next two generations. It might be Ebola, avian flu, a drug-resistant superbug, or something completely new, like the novel virus the world is confronting today. While it was impossible to predict the emergence of SARS-CoV-2—and it remains impossible to predict which pathogen will cause the next global outbreak—by unraveling the stories of pandemics past we can begin to better understand our own future, and to prepare for what it holds in store.In Pandemic: Tracking Contagions, from Cholera to Ebola and Beyond, Sonia Shah interweaves history, original reportage, and personal narrative to explore the origins of epidemics, drawing parallels between cholera—one of history’s most deadly and disruptive pandemic-causing pathogens—and the new diseases that stalk humankind today. She tracks each stage of cholera’s dramatic journey, from its emergence in the South Asian hinterlands as a harmless microbe to its rapid dispersal across the nineteenth-century world, all the way to its latest beachhead in Haiti. Along the way she reports on the pathogens now following in cholera’s footsteps, from the MRSA bacterium that besieges her own family to the never-before-seen killers coming out of China’s wet markets, the surgical wards of New Delhi, and the suburban backyards of the East Coast.Delving into the convoluted science, strange politics, and checkered history of one of the world’s deadliest diseases, Pandemic is a work of epidemiological history like no other, with urgent lessons for our own time.“Shah proves a disquieting Virgil, guiding us through the hells ruled by [infectious diseases] . . . the power of Shah's account lies in her ability to track simultaneously the multiple dimensions of the public-health crises we are facing.” —The Chicago Tribune","","362.1","2021-11-10T22:51:32-08:00","2021-09-14T00:00:00-07:00","Public health surveillance, Communicable diseases--Epidemiology","","23847947","9780374122881","9780374122881","goodreads:23847947,oclc:907585936,isbn:9780374122881,lc_authority_name:n97054987,viaf_author_id:8251956,lccn:lccn-n97054987,google:33d6CwAAQBAJ,ltid:208333133,isni:0000000115923404,oclc-owi:2926137930","","RA643","[Pandemic: Tracking Contagions, From Cholera to Ebola and Beyond](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333133)

"","","Rubin, Gretchen","Gretchen Rubin","""With clarity and humor, bestselling author of The Four Tendencies and The Happiness Project Gretchen Rubin illuminates one of her key realizations about happiness: For most of us, outer order contributes to inner calm. And for most of us, a rigid, one-size-fits-all solution doesn't work. In this easy-to-read but hard-to-put-down book, Gretchen Rubin suggests more than 150 short, concrete clutter-clearing ideas so each reader can choose the ones that resonate most. The fact is, when we tailor our approach to suit our own particular challenges and habits, we're far more likely to be able to create the order that will make our lives happier, healthier, more productive, and more creative. In the context of a happy life, a messy desk or crowded coat closet is a trivial problem--yet Gretchen Rubin has found that getting control of our stuff makes us feel more in control of our lives. By getting rid of things we don't use, don't need, or don't love, as well as things that don't work, don't fit, or don't suit, we free our mind (and our shelves) for what we truly value. In this trim book filled with insights, strategies, and sometimes surprising tips, Gretchen tackles the key challenges of creating outer order, by explaining how to ""Make Choices,"" ""Create Order,"" ""Know Yourself--and Others,"" ""Cultivate Helpful Habits,"" and, of course, ""Add Beauty."" At home, at work, and in life, when we get our possessions under control we feel both calmer and more energetic. With a sense of fun, and also a clear idea of what's realistic for most people, Gretchen Rubin suggests dozens of manageable steps for creating a more serene, orderly environment--one that helps us to create the lives we yearn for""--","","158","2021-11-10T22:51:32-08:00","2021-09-13T00:00:00-07:00","Self-actualization (Psychology), Happiness, Success, Orderliness, Simplicity, Storage in the home, Organization","","39901314","9781984822802","9781984822802","oclc-owi:4906755645,ltid:208333225,google:jcKGDwAAQBAJ,viaf_author_id:79472830,oclc:1045665883,lc_authority_name:n00098561,isni:0000000120292782,lccn:lccn-n00098561,isbn:9781984822802,goodreads:39901314","","BF637.S4","[Outer Order, Inner Calm: Declutter & Organize to Make More Room for Happiness](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333225)

"","","Levy, Mark","Mark Levy","NEW EDITION, REVISED AND UPDATED  When it comes to creating ideas, we hold ourselves back. That's because inside each of us is an internal editor whose job is to forever polish our thoughts, so we sound smart and in control, and so that we fit into society. But what happens when we encounter problems where such conventional thinking fails us? How to get unstuck?   For Mark Levy, the answer is freewriting, a technique he's used for years to solve all types of business problems, and generate ideas for books, articles and blog posts.   Freewriting is deceptively simple: Start writing as fast as you can, for as long as you can, about a subject you care deeply about, while ignoring the standard rules of grammar and spelling. Your internal editor won't be able to keep up with your output, and will be temporarily shunted into the background. You'll now be able to think more honestly and resourcefully than before, and will generate breakthrough ideas and solutions that you couldn't have created any other way.   Levy shares six freewriting secrets designed to knock out your editor and let your genius run free. He also includes fifteen problem-solving and creativity-stimulating principles you can use if you need more firepower—seven of which are new to this edition—and stories of problems he and others have solved through freewriting.   Also new to this edition: an extensive section on how to refine your freewriting into something you can share with the world. Although Levy originally taught freewriting as a private brainstorming technique, over the years he and his clients have found that, with some tweaking, it's a great way to generate content for books, articles, and other thought leadership pieces.","","808.042","2021-11-10T22:51:32-08:00","2021-09-11T00:00:00-07:00","Business writing, Critical thinking, English language--Rhetoric, Problem solving, Creative ability in business","","8360431","9781605095257","9781605095257","google:47cquAAACAAJ,ltid:208333124,isbn:9781605095257,goodreads:8360431,oclc-owi:3377259727,oclc:43952127,lc_authority_name:n00037456,viaf_author_id:163773690,isni:0000000114832586,lccn:lccn-n00037456","Levyˏ Mark : 1962-","PE1479.B87","[Accidental Genius: Using Writing to Generate Your Best Ideas, Insight, and Content](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333124)

"","","Headlee, Celeste","Celeste Headlee","We work feverishly to make ourselves happy. So why are we so miserable? This manifesto helps us break free of our unhealthy devotion to efficiency and shows us how to reclaim our time and humanity with a little more leisure.  Despite our constant search for new ways to optimize our bodies and minds for peak performance, human beings are working more instead of less, living harder not smarter, and becoming more lonely and anxious. We strive for the absolute best in every aspect of our lives, ignoring what we do well naturally and reaching for a bar that keeps rising higher and higher. Why do we measure our time in terms of efficiency instead of meaning? Why can't we just take a break?  In Do Nothing, award-winning journalist Celeste Headlee illuminates a new path ahead, seeking to institute a global shift in our thinking so we can stop sabotaging our well-being, put work aside, and start living instead of doing. As it turns out, we're searching for external solutions to an internal problem. We won't find what we're searching for in punishing diets, productivity apps, or the latest self-improvement schemes. Yet all is not lost - we just need to learn how to take time for ourselves, without agenda or profit, and redefine what is truly worthwhile.  Pulling together threads from history, neuroscience, social science, and even paleontology, Headlee examines long-held assumptions about time use, idleness, hard work, and even our ultimate goals. Her research reveals that the habits we cling to are doing us harm; they developed recently in human history, which means they are habits that can, and must, be broken. It's time to reverse the trend that's making us all sadder, sicker, and less productive, and return to a way of life that allows us to thrive.","","158","2021-11-10T22:51:32-08:00","2021-09-09T00:00:00-07:00","Work--Psychological aspects, Happiness, Leisure, Well-being, Work-life balance, Quality of work life, Quality of life","","52668196","9781984824738","9781984824738","google:kLXPDwAAQBAJ,ltid:208333122,goodreads:52668196,isbn:9781984824738,oclc-owi:9399626022,oclc:1108144637,lc_authority_name:nr95043127,viaf_author_id:56504659,isni:0000000049531591,lccn:lccn-nr95043127","Headleeˏ Celeste Anne : 1969-","BJ1498","[Do Nothing: How to Break Away From Overworking, Overdoing, and Underliving](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333122)

"","","Levitin, Daniel J.","Daniel J. Levitin","**It's raining fringe theories, fake news, and pseudo-facts. These lies are getting repeated. *New York Times* bestselling author Daniel Levitin shows how to disarm these socially devastating inventions and get the American mind back on track. Here are the fundamental lessons in critical thinking (previously published as *A Field Guide to Lies* ) that we need to know and share now.**    Investigating numerical misinformation, Daniel Levitin shows how mishandled statistics and graphs can give a grossly distorted perspective and lead us to terrible decisions. Wordy arguments on the other hand can easily be persuasive as they drift away from the facts in an appealing yet misguided way. The steps we can take to better evaluate news, advertisements, and reports are clearly detailed. Ultimately, Levitin turns to what underlies our ability to determine if something is true or false: the scientific method. He grapples with the limits of what we can and cannot know. Case studies are offered to demonstrate the applications of logical thinking to quite varied settings, spanning courtroom testimony, medical decision making, magic, modern physics, and conspiracy theories.    This urgently needed book enables us to avoid the extremes of passive gullibility and cynical rejection. As Levitin attests: Truth matters. A post-truth era is an era of willful irrationality, reversing all the great advances humankind has made. Euphemisms like ""fringe theories,"" ""extreme views,"" ""alt truth,"" and even ""fake news"" can literally be dangerous. Let's call lies what they are and catch those making them in the act.","","153.42","2021-11-10T22:51:32-08:00","2021-09-08T00:00:00-07:00","Reasoning, Critical thinking, Fallacies (Logic), Trust, Statistics--Evaluation, Information literacy","","33932218","9781101983829","9781101983829","goodreads:33932218,isbn:9781101983829,lc_authority_name:n2002016616,isni:0000000110417430,viaf_author_id:17470044,oclc:968310760,ltid:208333130,lccn:lccn-n2002016616,google:O4pGMQAACAAJ,oclc-owi:2890485146","Redline [Publisher]","BC177","[Weaponized Lies: How to Think Critically in the Post-Truth Era](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333130)

Inventing the Future is a major new manifesto that argues for a novel set of alternatives for the future - alternatives which seek to rekindle a popular modernity. Against the confused understanding of the hi-tech and neoliberal world by both the right and the left, this book claims that the emancipatory and future-oriented possibilities of our society can be reclaimed. Instead of running from a complex future the authors envisage a post-capitalist economy which is capable of advancing living standards, liberating humanity from work, and developing technologies which free us from biological and environmental constraints.","","303.44","2021-11-10T22:51:32-08:00","2021-09-07T00:00:00-07:00","Capitalism, Progress, Neoliberalism, Populism, Radicalism, Social movements, Common good, Technology--Social aspects--Forecasting","","25387807","9781784780968","9781784780968","ltid:208333119,google:CI31rQEACAAJ,isbn:9781784780968,goodreads:25387807,oclc-owi:2765510913,oclc:927140713,lc_authority_name:no2011168883,viaf_author_id:311353604,lccn:lccn-no2011168883","Williamsˏ Alex : 1981- [Author], Verso (Firm : Londonˏ England) [Publisher]","HM891","[Inventing the Future: Folk Politics and the Left](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333119)

"","","John, Daymond & Paisner, Daniel","Daymond John & Daniel Paisner","The instant New York Times bestseller from Shark Tank star and Fubu Founder Daymond John on why starting a business on a limited budget can be an entrepreneur's greatest competitive advantage.  Daymond John has been practicing the power of broke ever since he started selling his home-sewn t-shirts on the streets of Queens. With a $40 budget, Daymond had to strategize out-of-the-box ways to promote his products. Luckily, desperation breeds innovation, and so he hatched an idea for a creative campaign that eventually launched the FUBU brand into a $6 billion dollar global phenomenon. But it might not have happened if he hadn't started out broke - with nothing but hope and a ferocious drive to succeed by any means possible.  Here, the FUBU founder and star of ABC's Shark Tank shows that, far from being a liability, broke can actually be your greatest competitive advantage as an entrepreneur. Why? Because starting a business from broke forces you to think more creatively. It forces you to use your resources more efficiently. It forces you to connect with your customers more authentically, and market your ideas more imaginatively. It forces you to be true to yourself, stay laser focused on your goals, and come up with those innovative solutions required to make a meaningful mark.   Drawing his own experiences as an entrepreneur and branding consultant, peeks behind-the scenes from the set of Shark Tank, and stories of dozens of other entrepreneurs who have hustled their way to wealth, John shows how we can all leverage the power of broke to phenomenal success. You'll meet:  · Steve Aoki, the electronic dance music (EDM) deejay who managed to parlay a series of $100 gigs into becoming a global superstar who has redefined the music industry · Gigi Butler, a cleaning lady from Nashville who built cupcake empire on the back of a family recipe, her maxed out credit cards, and a heaping dose of faith · 11-year old Shark Tank guest Mo Bridges who stitched together a winning clothing line with just his grandma's sewing machine, a stash of loose fabric, and his unique sartorial flair  When your back is up against the wall, your bank account is empty, and creativity and passion are the only resources you can afford, success is your only option. Here you'll learn how to tap into that Power of Broke to scrape, hustle, and dream your way to the top.","","658.11","2021-11-10T22:51:32-08:00","2021-09-05T00:00:00-07:00","New business enterprises, Creative ability in business, Entrepreneurship, Strategic planning, Success in business","","25430691","9781101903599","9781101903599","ltid:208333118,goodreads:25430691,google:FTXZCwAAQBAJ,isbn:9781101903599,oclc-owi:2891479532,oclc:919041663,lc_authority_name:n86129168,viaf_author_id:49359449,isni:0000000107810493,lccn:lccn-n86129168","Johnˏ Daymond : 1969-, Paisnerˏ Daniel [Author]","HD62.5","[The Power of Broke: How Empty Pockets, a Tight Budget, and a Hunger for Success Can Become Your Greatest Competitive Advantage](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333118)

"","","Bogle, John C.","John C. Bogle","""There are a few investment managers, of course, who are very good - though in the short run, it's difficult to determine whether a great record is due to luck or talent. Most advisors, however, are far better at generating high fees than they are at generating high returns. In truth, their core competence is salesmanship. Rather than listen to their siren songs, investors - large and small - should instead read Jack Bogle's *The Little Book of Common Sense Investing*."" - Warren Buffett, Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, 2014 Annual Shareholder Letter.  Investing is all about common sense. Owning a diversified portfolio of stocks and holding it for the long term is a winner's game. Trying to beat the stock market is theoretically a zero-sum game (for every winner, there must be a loser), but after the substantial costs of investing are deducted, it becomes a loser's game. Common sense tells us--and history confirms--that the simplest and most efficient investment strategy is to buy and hold all of the nation's publicly held businesses at very low cost. The classic index fund that owns this market portfolio is the *only* investment that guarantees you with your fair share of stock market returns. To learn how to make index investing work for you, there's no better mentor than legendary mutual fund industry veteran John C. Bogle. Over the course of his long career, Bogle--founder of the Vanguard Group and creator of the world's first index mutual fund--has relied primarily on index investing to help Vanguard's clients build substantial wealth. Now, with *The Little Book of Common Sense Investing,* he wants to help you do the same.  Filled with in-depth insights and practical advice, *The Little Book of Common Sense Investing* will show you how to incorporate this proven investment strategy into your portfolio. It will also change the very way you think about investing. Successful investing is not easy. (It requires discipline and patience.) But it is simple. For it's all about common sense.  With *The Little Book of Common Sense Investing* as your guide, you'll discover how to make investing a winner's game:  Why business reality--dividend yields and earnings growth--is more important than market expectations How to overcome the powerful impact of investment costs, taxes, and inflation How the magic of compounding returns is overwhelmed by the tyranny of compounding costs What expert investors and brilliant academics--from Warren Buffett and Benjamin Graham to Paul Samuelson and Burton Malkiel--have to say about index investing And much more You'll also find warnings about investment fads and fashions, including the recent stampede into exchange traded funds and the rise of indexing gimmickry. The real formula for investment success is to own the entire market, while significantly minimizing the costs of financial intermediation. That's what index investing is all about. And that's what this book is all about.","","332.6327","2021-11-10T22:51:32-08:00","2021-09-03T00:00:00-07:00","Index mutual funds, Investments, Portfolio management, Securities, United States, Stock index futures","","171127","9780470102107","9780470102107","isbn:9780470102107,goodreads:171127,ltid:208333108,google:XhlLygEACAAJ,oclc-owi:796448740,oclc:76871376,lc_authority_name:n93043137,viaf_author_id:79568747,isni:0000000109195332,lccn:lccn-n93043137,loc_lccn:2006037552","","HG4530","[The Little Book of Common Sense Investing: The Only Way to Guarantee Your Fair Share of Stock Market Returns](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333108)

"","","Marks, Howard","Howard Marks","""This is that rarity, a useful book.""--Warren Buffett  Howard Marks, the chairman and cofounder of Oaktree Capital Management, is renowned for his insightful assessments of market opportunity and risk. After four decades spent ascending to the top of the investment management profession, he is today sought out by the world's leading value investors, and his client memos brim with insightful commentary and a time-tested, fundamental philosophy. Now for the first time, all readers can benefit from Marks's wisdom, concentrated into a single volume that speaks to both the amateur and seasoned investor.  Informed by a lifetime of experience and study, *The Most Important Thing* explains the keys to successful investment and the pitfalls that can destroy capital or ruin a career. Utilizing passages from his memos to illustrate his ideas, Marks teaches by example, detailing the development of an investment philosophy that fully acknowledges the complexities of investing and the perils of the financial world. Brilliantly applying insight to today's volatile markets, Marks offers a volume that is part memoir, part creed, with a number of broad takeaways.  Marks expounds on such concepts as ""second-level thinking,"" the price/value relationship, patient opportunism, and defensive investing. Frankly and honestly assessing his own decisions--and occasional missteps--he provides valuable lessons for critical thinking, risk assessment, and investment strategy. Encouraging investors to be ""contrarian,"" Marks wisely judges market cycles and achieves returns through aggressive yet measured action. Which element is the most essential? Successful investing requires thoughtful attention to many separate aspects, and each of Marks's subjects proves to be *the most important thing*.","","332.6","2021-11-10T22:51:32-08:00","2021-09-02T00:00:00-07:00","Investment analysis, Investments, Portfolio management, Risk management","","10454418","9780231153683","9780231153683","google:Ds3DwAEACAAJ,ltid:208333125,isbn:9780231153683,goodreads:10454418,oclc-owi:895254719,oclc:693812317,lc_authority_name:n2005042455,viaf_author_id:19089602,isni:0000000120219374,lccn:lccn-n2005042455","Marksˏ Howard : 1946-","HG4521","[The Most Important Thing: Uncommon Sense for the Thoughtful Investor](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333125)

"","","Holiday, Ryan","Ryan Holiday","#1 Wall Street Journal Bestseller  The Obstacle is the Way has become a cult classic, beloved by men and women around the world who apply its wisdom to become more successful at whatever they do. Its many fans include a former governor and movie star (Arnold Schwarzenegger), a hip hop icon (LL Cool J), an Irish tennis pro (James McGee), an NBC sportscaster (Michele Tafoya), and the coaches and players of winning teams like the New England Patriots, Seattle Seahawks, Chicago Cubs, and University of Texas men's basketball team.  The book draws its inspiration from stoicism, the ancient Greek philosophy of enduring pain or adversity with perseverance and resilience. Stoics focus on the things they can control, let go of everything else, and turn every new obstacle into an opportunity to get better, stronger, tougher. As Marcus Aurelius put it nearly 2000 years ago: ""The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way.""   Ryan Holiday shows us how some of the most successful people in history--from John D. Rockefeller to Amelia Earhart to Ulysses S. Grant to Steve Jobs--have applied stoicism to overcome difficult or even impossible situations. Their embrace of these principles ultimately mattered more than their natural intelligence, talents, or luck.  If you're feeling frustrated, demoralized, or stuck in a rut, this book can help you turn your problems into your biggest advantages. And along the way it will inspire you with dozens of true stories of the greats from every age and era.","","158","2021-11-10T22:51:32-08:00","2021-08-31T00:00:00-07:00","Motivation (Psychology), Self-realization","","18668059","9781591846352","9781591846352","ltid:208333114,goodreads:18668059,isbn:9781591846352,google:jWqJDQAAQBAJ,oclc-owi:3072323096,oclc:864418200,lc_authority_name:n2012017952,viaf_author_id:80149842001602841669,isni:0000000366934933,lccn:lccn-n2012017952","","BF503","[The Obstacle Is the Way: The Timeless Art of Turning Trials Into Triumph](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333114)

Not to be missed by anyone who wants to understand how ideas change the world.” —Daniel Kahneman, winner of the Nobel Prize and author of Thinking, Fast and Slow What do James Bond and Lipitor have in common? What can we learn about human nature and world history from a glass of water?In Loonshots, physicist and entrepreneur Safi Bahcall reveals a surprising new way of thinking about the mysteries of group behavior that challenges everything we thought we knew about nurturing radical breakthroughs.Drawing on the science of phase transitions, Bahcall shows why teams, companies, or any group with a mission will suddenly change from embracing wild new ideas to rigidly rejecting them, just as flowing water will suddenly change into brittle ice. Mountains of print have been written about culture. Loonshots identifies the small shifts in structure that control this transition, the same way that temperature controls the change from water to ice.Using examples that range from the spread of fires in forests to the hunt for terrorists online, and stories of thieves and geniuses and kings, Bahcall shows how this new kind of science helps us understand the behavior of companies and the fate of empires. Loonshots distills these insights into lessons for creatives, entrepreneurs, and visionaries everywhere.Over the past decade, researchers have been applying the tools and techniques of phase transitions to understand how birds flock, fish swim, brains work, people vote, criminals behave, ideas spread, diseases erupt, and ecosystems collapse.

"","","Diamandis, Peter H. & Kotler, Steven","Peter H. Diamandis & Steven Kotler","Since the dawn of humanity, a privileged few have lived in stark contrast to the hardscrabble majority. Conventional wisdom says this gap cannot be closed. But it is closing--fast. In Abundance, space entrepreneur turned innovation pioneer Peter H. Diamandis and award-winning science writer Steven Kotler document how progress in artificial intelligence, robotics, infinite computing, ubiquitous broadband networks, digital manufacturing, nanomaterials, synthetic biology, and many other exponentially growing technologies will enable us to make greater gains in the next two decades than we have in the previous two hundred years. We will soon have the ability to meet and exceed the basic needs of every man, woman, and child on the planet. Abundance for all is within our grasp. Breaking down human needs by category--water, food, energy, health care, education, freedom--Diamandis and Kotler introduce us to dozens of innovators and industry captains making tremendous strides in each are: Dean Kamen's Slingshot, a technology that can transform polluted water, salt water or even raw sewage into high-quality drinking water for less that once cent a liter; the Qualcomm Tricorder X PRIZE which promises a low-cost, handheld medical device that allows anyone to diagnose themselves better than a board certified-doctor; Dickson Despommier's ""vertical farms,"" which replaces traditional agriculture with a system that uses 80 percent less land, 90 percent less water, 100 percent fewer pesticides, adn zero transportation costs. The authors also provide a detailed reference section filled with ninety graphs, charts and graphics offering much of the source data underpinning their conclusions. In this antidote to today's pessimism, the authors explore how four emerging forces-exponential technologies, the DIY innovator, the Technophilanthropist, and the Rising Billion--are conspiring to solve our biggest problems. Diamandis and Kotler examine the stunning impact of these forces while establishing hard targets for change; laying out a strategic road map for governments, industry, and entrepreneurs, adn giving us plenty of reason for optimism.","","303.483","2021-11-10T22:51:32-08:00","2021-08-27T00:00:00-07:00","Technological forecasting, Technological innovations--Forecasting, Technology--Social aspects, Social prediction, Economic forecasting","","13187824","9781451614213","9781451614213","goodreads:13187824,oclc:741542469,isni:000000035860861,google:lCifxlN8ZIoC,lc_authority_name:n2011076867,oclc-owi:1096966137,isbn:9781451614213,lccn:lccn-n2011076867,viaf_author_id:209908036,ltid:208333113","Kotlerˏ Steven : 1967- [Author]","T173.8","[Abundance: The Future Is Better Than You Think](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333113)

"","","Holmes, Jamie","Jamie Holmes","**An illuminating look at the surprising upside of ambiguity—and how, properly harnessed, it can inspire learning, creativity, even empathy** * * * Life today feels more overwhelming and chaotic than ever. Whether it’s a confounding work problem or a faltering relationship or an unclear medical diagnosis, we face constant uncertainty. And we’re continually bombarded with information, much of it contradictory.  Managing ambiguity—in our jobs, our relationships, and daily lives—is quickly becoming an essential skill. Yet most of us don’t know where to begin.  As Jamie Holmes shows in *Nonsense* , being confused is unpleasant, so we tend to shutter our minds as we grasp for meaning and stability, especially in stressful circumstances. We’re hard-wired to resolve contradictions quickly and extinguish anomalies. This can be useful, of course. When a tiger is chasing you, you can’t be indecisive. But as *Nonsense* reveals, our need for closure has its own dangers. It makes us stick to our first answer, which is not always the best, and it makes us search for meaning in the wrong places. When we latch onto fast and easy truths, we lose a vital opportunity to learn something new, solve a hard problem, or see the world from another perspective.  In other words, confusion—that uncomfortable mental place—has a hidden upside. We just need to know how to use it. This lively and original book points the way.  Over the last few years, new insights from social psychology and cognitive science have deepened our understanding of the role of ambiguity in our lives and Holmes brings this research together for the first time, showing how we can use uncertainty to our advantage. Filled with illuminating stories—from spy games and doomsday cults to Absolut Vodka’s ad campaign and the creation of Mad Libs— *Nonsense* promises to transform the way we conduct business, educate our children, and make decisions.  In an increasingly unpredictable, complex world, it turns out that what matters most isn’t IQ, willpower, or confidence in what we know. It’s how we deal with what we don’t understand.","","153.4","2021-11-10T22:51:32-08:00","2021-08-25T00:00:00-07:00","Uncertainty, Creative ability, Decision making","","22822855","9780385348379","9780385348379","google:2oPZCwAAQBAJ,goodreads:22822855,ltid:208333100,isbn:9780385348379,oclc-owi:2301931628,oclc:904012185,lc_authority_name:n2015011755,viaf_author_id:314896392,lccn:lccn-n2015011755","","BF463.U5","[Nonsense: The Power of Not Knowing](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333100)

"","","Dutton, Kevin","Kevin Dutton","**A groundbreaking and timely book about how evolutionary biology can explain our black-and-white brains, and a lesson in how we can escape the pitfalls of binary thinking.** Several million years ago, natural selection equipped us with binary, black-and-white brains. Though the world was arguably simpler back then, it was in many ways much more dangerous. Not coincidentally, the binary brain was highly adept at detecting risk: the ability to analyze threats and respond to changes in the sensory environment--a drop in temperature, the crack of a branch--was essential to our survival as a species.  Since then, the world has evolved--but we, for the most part, haven't. Confronted with a panoply of shades of gray, our brains have a tendency to ""force quit: "" to sort the things we see, hear, and experience into manageable but simplistic categories. We stereotype, pigeon-hole, and, above all, draw lines where in reality there are none. In our modern, interconnected world, it might seem like we are ill-equipped to deal with the challenges we face--that living with a binary brain is like trying to navigate a teeming city center with a map that shows only highways.  In *Black-and-White Thinking* , the renowned psychologist Kevin Dutton pulls back the curtains of the mind to reveal a new way of thinking about a problem as old as humanity itself. While our instinct for categorization often leads us astray, encouraging polarization, rigid thinking, and sometimes outright denialism, it is an essential component of the mental machinery we use to make sense of the world. Simply put, unless we perceived our environment as a chessboard, our brains wouldn't be able to play the game.  Using the latest advances in psychology, neuroscience, and evolutionary biology, Dutton shows how we can optimize our tendency to categorize and fine-tune our minds to avoid the pitfalls of too little, and too much, complexity. He reveals the enduring importance of three ""super categories""-- *fight or flight* , *us versus them* , and *right or wrong* \--and argues that they remain essential to not only convincing others to change their minds but to changing the world for the better. *Black-and-White Thinking* is a scientifically informed wake-up call for an era of increasing extremism and a thought-provoking, uplifting guide to training our gray matter to see that gray really does matter.","","150.195","2021-11-10T22:51:33-08:00","2021-08-23T00:00:00-07:00","Social psychology, Human behavior, Categorization (Psychology), Instinct","","53359432","9780374110345","9780374110345","google:TwyEzQEACAAJ,goodreads:53359432,ltid:208333109,isbn:9780374110345,oclc-owi:10284819779,oclc:1122923074,lc_authority_name:no2013123614,viaf_author_id:58501281,isni:0000000067677383,lccn:lccn-no2013123614","Duttonˏ Kevin : 1967-","BF445","[Black-And-White Thinking: The Burden of a Binary Brain in a Complex World](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333109)

But even she's been challenged by the enemy of progress known as fear. She was once afraid to call herself a writer, and nearly skipped out on doing a TED talk that changed her life because of imposter syndrome. As she shares in Professional Troublemaker, she's not alone.  We're all afraid. We're afraid of asking for what we want because we're afraid of hearing ""no."" We're afraid of being different, of being too much or not enough. We're afraid of leaving behind the known for the unknown. But in order to do the things that will truly, meaningfully change our lives, we have to become professional troublemakers: people who are committed to not letting fear talk them out of the things they need to do or say to live free.  With humor and honesty, and guided by the influence of her professional troublemaking Nigerian grandmother, Funmilayo Faloyin, Luvvie walks us through what we must get right within ourselves before we can do the things that scare us; how to use our voice for a greater good; and how to put movement to the voice we've been silencing--because truth-telling is a muscle.  The point is not to be fearless, but to know we are afraid and charge forward regardless. It is to recognize that the things we must do are more significant than our fears. This book is about how to live boldly in spite of all the reasons we have to cower.

"","","Altucher, James","James Altucher","**The entrepreneur, angel investor, and bestselling author of *Choose Yourself* busts the 10,000-hour rule of achieving mastery, offering a new mindset and dozens of techniques that will inspire any professional—no matter their age or managerial level—to pursue their passions and quickly acquire the skills they need to succeed and achieve their dreams.** We live in a hierarchical world where experience has traditionally been the key to promotion. But that period is over! Straight, clear-cut career trajectories no longer exist. Industries disappear, job descriptions change, and people’s interests and passions evolve. The key to riding this wave, entrepreneur James Altucher advises, is to constantly be curious about what’s next, to be comfortable with uncertainty so you can keep navigating the rough waters ahead, and most important, to pursue the things that interest you.  In *Skip the Line,* he reveals how he went from struggling and depressed to making his personal, financial, and creative dreams come true, despite—and perhaps due to—his many failures along the way. Altucher combines his personal story with concrete—and unorthodox—insights that work. But *Skip the Line* isn’t about hacks and shortcuts—it’s about transforming the way you think, work, and live, letting your interests guide your learning, time, and resources. It’s about allowing yourself to do what comes naturally; the more you do what you love, the better you do it. While showing you how to approach change and crisis, Altucher gives you tools to help easily execute ideas, become an expert negotiator, attract the attention of those around you, scale promising ideas, and improve leadership—all of which will catapult you higher than you ever thought possible and at a speed that everyone will tell you is impossible.","","650.1","2021-11-10T22:51:33-08:00","2021-08-19T00:00:00-07:00","Self-realization, Success, Entrepreneurship, Success in business","","53746011","9780062998934","9780062998934","isbn:9780062998934,ltid:208333105,goodreads:53746011,google:MK7sDwAAQBAJ,oclc-owi:10525213040,oclc:1195816120,lc_authority_name:n2003113927,viaf_author_id:79562820,isni:0000000056229665,lccn:lccn-n2003113927","","HB615","[Skip the Line: The 10,000 Experiments Rule and Other Surprising Advice for Reaching Your Goals](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333105)

"","","Kross, Ethan","Ethan Kross","****NATIONAL BESTSELLER - An award-winning psychologist reveals the hidden power of our inner voice and shows how to harness it to combat anxiety, improve physical and mental health, and deepen our relationships with others.* * ** ""A masterpiece.""--Angela Duckworth, bestselling author of *Grit* \- Malcolm Gladwell, Susan Cain, Adam Grant, and Daniel H. Pink's Next Big Idea Club Winter 2021 Winning Selection  One of the best new books of the year-- *The Washington Post,* BBC, *USA Today,* *CNN Underscored, Shape, Behavioral Scientist, PopSugar* \- *Kirkus Reviews, Publishers Weekly,* and *Shelf Awareness* starred reviews  Tell a stranger that you talk to yourself, and you're likely to get written off as eccentric. But the truth is that we all have a voice in our head. When we talk to ourselves, we often hope to tap into our inner coach but find our inner critic instead. When we're facing a tough task, our inner coach can buoy us up: Focus--you can do this. But, just as often, our inner critic sinks us entirely: I'm going to fail. They'll all laugh at me. What's the use?  In *Chatter* , acclaimed psychologist Ethan Kross explores the silent conversations we have with ourselves. Interweaving groundbreaking behavioral and brain research from his own lab with real-world case studies--from a pitcher who forgets how to pitch, to a Harvard undergrad negotiating her double life as a spy--Kross explains how these conversations shape our lives, work, and relationships. He warns that giving in to negative and disorienting self-talk--what he calls ""chatter""--can tank our health, sink our moods, strain our social connections, and cause us to fold under pressure.  But the good news is that we're already equipped with the tools we need to make our inner voice work in our favor. These tools are often hidden in plain sight--in the words we use to think about ourselves, the technologies we embrace, the diaries we keep in our drawers, the conversations we have with our loved ones, and the cultures we create in our schools and workplaces.  Brilliantly argued, expertly researched, and filled with compelling stories, *Chatter* gives us the power to change the most important conversation we have each day: the one we have with ourselves.","","158.1","2021-11-10T22:51:33-08:00","2021-08-18T00:00:00-07:00","Self-talk, Thought and thinking, Communication--Psychological aspects","","53330118","9780525575238","9780525575238","google:BV0REAAAQBAJ,ltid:208333103,isbn:9780525575238,goodreads:53330118,oclc-owi:10194516038,oclc:1158504854,lc_authority_name:n2020030153,viaf_author_id:4159233875303370324,isni:000000050276022,lccn:lccn-n2020030153","","BF697.5.S47","[Chatter: The Voice in Our Head, Why It Matters, and How to Harness It](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333103)

"","","Newport, Cal","Cal Newport","***** New York Times* bestseller!** **  From *New York Times* bestselling author Cal Newport comes a bold vision for liberating workers from the tyranny of the inbox--and unleashing a new era of productivity.  Modern knowledge workers communicate constantly. Their days are defined by a relentless barrage of incoming messages and back-and-forth digital conversations--a state of constant, anxious chatter in which nobody can disconnect, and so nobody has the cognitive bandwidth to perform substantive work. There was a time when tools like email felt cutting edge, but a thorough review of current evidence reveals that the hyperactive hive mind workflow they helped create has become a productivity disaster, reducing profitability and perhaps even slowing overall economic growth. Equally worrisome, it makes us miserable. Humans are simply not wired for constant digital communication.  We have become so used to an inbox-driven workday that it's hard to imagine alternatives. But they do exist. Drawing on years of investigative reporting, author and computer science professor Cal Newport makes the case that our current approach to work is broken, then lays out a series of principles and concrete instructions for fixing it. In *A World without Email* , he argues for a workplace in which clear processes--not haphazard messaging--define how tasks are identified, assigned and reviewed. Each person works on fewer things (but does them better), and aggressive investment in support reduces the ever-increasing burden of administrative tasks. Above all else, important communication is streamlined, and inboxes and chat channels are no longer central to how work unfolds.  The knowledge sector's evolution beyond the hyperactive hive mind is inevitable. The question is not whether a world without email is coming (it is), but whether you'll be ahead of this trend. If you're a CEO seeking a competitive edge, an entrepreneur convinced your productivity could be higher, or an employee exhausted by your inbox, *A World Without Email* will convince you that the time has come for bold changes, and will walk you through exactly how to make them happen.","","384.34","2021-11-10T22:51:33-08:00","2021-08-17T00:00:00-07:00","Electronic mail messages, Business communication, Electronic mail systems, Success in business, Industrial efficiency","","54326146","9780525536550","9780525536550","google:ljsZEAAAQBAJ,isbn:9780525536550,goodreads:54326146,ltid:208333268,oclc-owi:10284883462,oclc:1237399844,lc_authority_name:n2004101272,viaf_author_id:1827152684006823430003,isni:0000000378709880,lccn:lccn-n2004101272","","HE7551","[A World Without Email: Reimagining Work in an Age of Communication Overload](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333268)

Or they could continue their quest to find the House of Hades, where they might be able to open the Doors of Death, rescue their friends Percy and Annabeth from Tartarus, and prevent monsters from being reincarnated in the mortal world. Whichever road they decide to take, they have to hurry, because time is running out. Gaea, the bloodthirsty Earth Mother, has set the date of August 1 for her rise to power.  **Annabeth and Percy are overwhelmed.** How will the two of them make it through Tartarus? Starving, thirsty, and in pain, they are barely able to stumble on in the dark and poisonous landscape that holds new horrors at every turn. They have no way of locating the Doors of Death. Even if they did, a legion of Gaea's strongest monsters guards the Doors on the Tartarus side. Annabeth and Percy can't exactly launch a frontal assault.  Despite the terrible odds, Hazel, Annabeth, Percy, and the other demigods of the prophecy know that there is only one choice: to attempt the impossible. Not just for themselves, but for everyone they love. Even though love can be the riskiest choice of all.

"","","Collins, James C.","James C. Collins","The Challenge Built to Last, the defining management study of the nineties, showed how great companies triumph over time and how long-term sustained performance can be engineered into the DNA of an enterprise from the verybeginning. But what about the company that is not born with great DNA? How can good companies, mediocre companies, even bad companies achieve enduring greatness? The Study For years, this question preyed on the mind of Jim Collins. Are there companies that defy gravity and convert long-term mediocrity or worse into long-term superiority? And if so, what are the universal distinguishing characteristics that cause a company to go from good to great? The Standards Using tough benchmarks, Collins and his research team identified a set of elite companies that made the leap to great results and sustained those results for at least fifteen years. How great? After the leap, the good-to-great companies generated cumulative stock returns that beat the general stock market by an average of seven times in fifteen years, better than twice the results delivered by a composite index of the world's greatest companies, including Coca-Cola, Intel, General Electric, and Merck.The Comparisons The research team contrasted the good-to-great companies with a carefully selected set of comparison companies that failed to make the leap from good to great. What was different? Why did one set of companies become truly great performers while the other set remained only good? Over five years, the team analyzed the histories of all twenty-eight companies in the study. After sifting through mountains of data and thousands of pages of interviews, Collins and his crew discovered the key determinants of greatness -- why some companies make the leap and others don't. The Findings The findings of the Good to Great study will surprise many readers and shed light on virtually every area of management strategy and practice. The findings include:Level 5 Leaders: The research team was shocked to discover the type of leadership required to achieve greatness. The Hedgehog Concept (Simplicity within the Three Circles): To go from good to great requires transcending the curse of competence.

"","","Barbour, Julian","Julian Barbour","**In *The Janus Point* renowned physicist Julian Barbour presents a major new solution to one of the most profound questions in physics - what is time? - with ground-breaking implications for the origin and destiny of our universe.** 'Both a work of literature and a masterpiece of scientific thought' Lee Smolin  Time is perhaps the greatest mystery in physics. Despite the fact that the fundamental laws of physics don't distinguish between past and future, we do. And so, for over a century, the greatest minds have sought to understand why time seems to flow in one direction, ever forward. In *The Janus Point,* Julian Barbour, author of the classic *The End of Time,* offers a radically new answer: it doesn't.  Most physicists believe that the second law of thermodynamics, and the increase of disorder that it describes, forces an irreversible, unidirectional flow of time. Barbour shows why that argument fails and demonstrates instead that our universe isn't heading for disorder; rather, it emerged from it. At the heart of his argument is a new vision of the Big Bang that Barbour calls the Janus Point, from which time flows in two directions, its currents driven by the expansion of the universe and the growth of order in the galaxies, planets, and life itself.  Monumental in vision and scope, *The Janus Point* is not just a new theory of time: it's a hopeful argument about the destiny of our universe. While most physicists predict that the universe will become mired in disorder, Barbour sees the possibility that order - the stuff of life - can grow without bound.","","530.11","2021-11-10T22:51:33-08:00","2021-08-13T00:00:00-07:00","Entropy, Second law of thermodynamics, Space and time, Thermodynamics, General relativity (Physics), Time, Cosmology","","36203417","9781473548862","9781473548862","ltid:208333320,google:w5g0DwAAQBAJ,goodreads:36203417,isbn:9781473548862,oclc-owi:9924151593,oclc:1004101036,lc_authority_name:n87871242,viaf_author_id:76822549,isni:0000000110719009,lccn:lccn-n87871242","","QC173.59.S65","[The Janus Point: A New Theory of Time](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333320)

"","","Simler, Kevin & Hanson, Robin","Kevin Simler & Robin Hanson","Human beings are primates, and primates are political animals. Our brains, therefore, are designed not just to hunt and gather, but also to help us get ahead socially, often via deception and self-deception. But while we may be self-interested schemers, we benefit by pretending otherwise. The less we know about our own ugly motives, the better - and thus we don't like to talk or even think about the extent of our selfishness. This is ""the elephant in the brain."" Such an introspective taboo makes it hard for us to think clearly about our nature and the explanations for our behavior. The aim of this book, then, is to confront our hidden motives directly - to track down the darker, unexamined corners of our psyches and blast them with floodlights. Then, once everything is clearly visible, we can work to better understand ourselves: Why do we laugh? Why are artists sexy? Why do we brag about travel? Why do we prefer to speak rather than listen?  Our unconscious motives drive more than just our private behavior; they also infect our venerated social institutions such as Art, School, Charity, Medicine, Politics, and Religion. In fact, these institutions are in many ways designed to accommodate our hidden motives, to serve covert agendas alongside their ""official"" ones. The existence of big hidden motives can upend the usual political debates, leading one to question the legitimacy of these social institutions, and of standard policies designed to favor or discourage them. You won't see yourself - or the world - the same after confronting the elephant in the brain.","","153.8","2021-11-10T22:51:33-08:00","2021-08-12T00:00:00-07:00","Self-deception, Subconsciousness, Cognitive psychology","","28820444","9780190496012","9780190496012","ltid:208333265,google:q_lADwAAQBAJ,isbn:9780190496012,goodreads:28820444,oclc-owi:4708081958,oclc:982092901,lc_authority_name:n2017028523,viaf_author_id:104149617083403751266,isni:0000000468794011,lccn:lccn-n2017028523","Simlerˏ Kevin : 1982-, Hansonˏ Robin : 1959- [Author]","BF697.5.S426","[The Elephant in the Brain: Hidden Motives in Everyday Life](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333265)

"","","Jiang, Jia","Jia Jiang","*Rejection Proof* is Jia Jiang's entertaining and inspiring account of conquering his fear of rejection, offering a completely new perspective on how to turn a no into a yes.  Jia Jiang came to the United States with the dream of being the next Bill Gates. Despite early success in the corporate world, his first attempt to pursue his entrepreneurial dream ended in rejection. Jia was crushed and spiraled into a period of deep self-doubt. But he realized that his fear of rejection was a bigger obstacle than any single rejection would ever be, and he needed to find a way to cope with being told no without letting it destroy him. Thus was born his ""100 days of rejection"" experiment, during which he willfully sought rejection on a daily basis - from requesting a lesson in sales from a car salesman (no) to asking a flight attendant if he could make an announcement on the loudspeaker (yes) to his famous request to get Krispy Kreme doughnuts in the shape of Olympic rings (yes, with a viral video to prove it).  Jia learned that even the most preposterous wish may be granted if you ask in the right way, and here he shares the secret of successful asking, how to pick targets, and how to tell when an initial no can be converted into something positive. But more important, he learned techniques for steeling himself against rejection and ways to develop his own confidence - a plan that can't be derailed by a single setback.  Filled with great stories and valuable insight, *Rejection Proof* is a fun and thoughtful examination of how to overcome fear and dare to live more boldly.","","158.2","2021-11-10T22:51:33-08:00","2021-08-08T00:00:00-07:00","Rejection (Psychology), Fear, Anxiety, Self-actualization (Psychology), Worry, Success in business, Change (Psychology), Interpersonal relations","","22747928","9780804141383","9780804141383","google:JPeKDQAAQBAJ,goodreads:22747928,isbn:9780804141383,ltid:208333260,oclc-owi:2485976648,oclc:904959648,lc_authority_name:no2015051053,viaf_author_id:315603763,lccn:lccn-no2015051053","Klaverenˏ Karl Van [Translator], Lemkeˏ Bettina [Translator]","BF575.R35","[Rejection Proof: How I Beat Fear and Became Invincible Through 100 Days of Rejection](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333260)

This is a wonderful book.""--Charles Duhigg, author of The Power of Habit and Smarter Faster Better  A crash on the Washington, D.C. metro system. An accidental overdose in a state-of-the-art hospital. An overcooked holiday meal. At first glance, these disasters seem to have little in common. But surprising new research shows that all these events--and the myriad failures that dominate headlines every day--share similar causes. By understanding what lies behind these failures, we can design better systems, make our teams more productive, and transform how we make decisions at work and at home.  Weaving together cutting-edge social science with riveting stories that take us from the frontlines of the Volkswagen scandal to backstage at the Oscars, and from deep beneath the Gulf of Mexico to the top of Mount Everest, Chris Clearfield and András Tilcsik explain how the increasing complexity of our systems creates conditions ripe for failure and why our brains and teams can't keep up. They highlight the paradox of progress: Though modern systems have given us new capabilities, they've become vulnerable to surprising meltdowns--and even to corruption and misconduct.  But Meltdown isn't just about failure; it's about solutions--whether you're managing a team or the chaos of your family's morning routine. It reveals why ugly designs make us safer, how a five-minute exercise can prevent billion-dollar catastrophes, why teams with fewer experts are better at managing risk, and why diversity is one of our best safeguards against failure. The result is an eye-opening, empowering, and entirely original book--one that will change the way you see our complex world and your own place in it.","","158.1","2021-11-10T22:51:33-08:00","2021-08-05T00:00:00-07:00","Organizational behavior, Social systems, System theory--Social aspects, Errors, Business failures, Organizational sociology, Decision making, Failure (Psychology)","","35629742","9780735222632","9780735222632","goodreads:35629742,ltid:208333263,isbn:9780735222632,google:EkXLswEACAAJ,oclc-owi:4413236927,oclc:993419323,lc_authority_name:no2018034077,viaf_author_id:1152199190014280254,isni:000000049908256,lccn:lccn-no2018034077","Tilcsikˏ András [Author; Other]","HM701","[Meltdown: Why Our Systems Fail and What We Can Do About It](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333263)

"","","McGonigal, Kelly","Kelly McGonigal","**The first book to explain the new science of self-control and how it can be harnessed to improve our health, happiness, and productivity.** After years of watching her students struggling with their choices, health psychologist Kelly McGonigal, Ph.D., realized that much of what people believe about willpower is actually sabotaging their success. Committed to sharing what the scientific community already knew about self-control, McGonigal created a course called ""The Science of Willpower"" for Stanford University's Continuing Studies Program. The course was an instant hit and spawned the hugely successful *Psychology Today* blog with the same name.  Informed by the latest research and combining cutting-edge insights from psychology, economics, neuroscience, and medicine, McGonigal's book explains exactly what willpower is, how it works, and why it matters. Readers will learn:  Willpower is a mind-body response, not a virtue. It is a biological function that can be improved through mindfulness, exercise, nutrition, and sleep. People who have better control of their attention, emotions, and actions are healthier, happier, have more satisfying relationships, and make more money. Willpower is not an unlimited resource. Too much self-control can actually be bad for your health. Temptation and stress hijack the brain's systems of self-control, and that the brain can be trained for greater willpower.  In the groundbreaking tradition of *Getting Things Done* , *The Willpower Instinct* combines life-changing prescriptive advice and complementary exercises to help readers with goals ranging from a healthier life to more patient parenting, from greater productivity at work to finally finishing the basement.","","153.8","2021-11-10T22:51:33-08:00","2021-08-01T00:00:00-07:00","Self-control, Will, Self-realization","","10865206","9781583334386","9781583334386","google:P31IngEACAAJ,goodreads:10865206,isbn:9781583334386,ltid:208333255,oclc-owi:919329694,oclc:738336661,lc_authority_name:no2010181741,viaf_author_id:160099745,lccn:lccn-no2010181741","Gefenˏ Sigal [Translator]","BF632","[The Willpower Instinct: How Self-Control Works, Why It Matters, and What You Can Do to Get More of It](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333255)

"","","Partnoy, Frank","Frank Partnoy","What do these scenarios have in common: a professional tennis player returning a serve, a woman evaluating a first date across the table, a naval officer assessing a threat to his ship, and a comedian about to reveal a punch line?  In this counterintuitive and insightful work, author Frank Partnoy weaves together findings from hundreds of scientific studies and interviews with wide-ranging experts to craft a picture of effective decision-making that runs counter to our brutally fast-paced world. Even as technology exerts new pressures to speed up our lives, it turns out that the choices we make--unconsciously and consciously, in time frames varying from milliseconds to years--benefit profoundly from delay. As this winning and provocative book reveals, taking control of time and slowing down our responses yields better results in almost every arena of life ... even when time seems to be of the essence.  The procrastinator in all of us will delight in Partnoy's accounts of celebrity ""delay specialists,"" from Warren Buffett to Chris Evert to Steve Kroft, underscoring the myriad ways in which delaying our reactions to everyday choices--large and small--can improve the quality of our lives.","","153.83","2021-11-10T22:51:33-08:00","2021-07-29T00:00:00-07:00","Procrastination, Decision making","","13237713","9781610390040","9781610390040","google:O_SyxUGB1dAC,isbn:9781610390040,ltid:208333248,goodreads:13237713,oclc-owi:1119663901,oclc:744287602,lc_authority_name:n97053647,viaf_author_id:22967822,isni:0000000110226386,lccn:lccn-n97053647","","BF637.P76","[Wait: The Art and Science of Delay](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333248)

The answers to such basic economic questions matter to everyone, yet the unfamiliar jargon and math of economics can seem daunting. This clear, accessible, and even humorous book is ideal for young readers new to economics and for all readers who seek a better understanding of the full sweep of economic history and ideas.  Economic historian Niall Kishtainy organizes short, chronological chapters that center on big ideas and events. He recounts the contributions of key thinkers including Adam Smith, David Ricardo, Karl Marx, John Maynard Keynes, and others, while examining topics ranging from the invention of money and the rise of agrarianism to the Great Depression, entrepreneurship, environmental destruction, inequality, and behavioral economics. The result is a uniquely enjoyable volume that succeeds in illuminating the economic ideas and forces that shape our world.","","330.09","2021-11-10T22:51:33-08:00","2021-07-29T00:00:00-07:00","Economic history, Economics, Economists","","32622193","9780300206364","9780300206364","isbn:9780300206364,oclc-owi:4143914090,viaf_author_id:300121811,goodreads:32622193,ltid:208333258,oclc:959373111,isni:0000000403360642,lccn:lccn-no2013050259,lc_authority_name:no2013050259","","HB71","[A Little History of Economics](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333258)

"","","Selk, Jason & Reed, Ellen","Jason Selk & Ellen Reed","**From bestselling author and mental toughness expert Jason Selk comes a mind-training regimen for reframing every problem into an opportunity for productive action.** The most common cause of failing to reach our professional and personal goals is hardwired in us: Humans instinctively focus on problems. Over millennia, our very survival relied on our ability to be alert to any potential dangers that could threaten our existence. But today this negativity bias significantly limits our potential and increases stress, pressure, and underperformance.  The one characteristic all phenomenally successful people share is mental toughness. Mentally tough people are better at making decisions more quickly and with better results. They possess the uncanny ability to control what goes on between their ears. Instead of allowing their minds to focus on their problems when adversity strikes, the most successful people have learned to direct their thoughts in a systematic manner that produces positive emotions and productive actions: they have a Relentless Solution Focus.  In this book, top performance coach Dr. Jason Selk--former Director of Mental Training for the World Series champions St. Louis Cardinals--and his colleague Dr. Ellen Reed provide the insight, tools, and proven step-by-step framework for you to do the same. When you have Relentless Solution Focus, you think better. Your decisions garner positive results. You take action and follow through--every time. And when you do get off track, you get back on with less effort and less drama. Weakness shrinks and strength grows, creating confidence and momentum, taking you and your team to higher levels of performance and achievement.","","153.43","2021-11-10T22:51:33-08:00","2021-07-27T00:00:00-07:00","Mental discipline, Performance, Problem solving, Success, Organizational effectiveness, Trust, Leadership","","54083654","9781260460117","9781260460117","isbn:9781260460117,ltid:208333249,google:wkJUygEACAAJ,goodreads:54083654,oclc-owi:10282734437,oclc:1159621523,lc_authority_name:n2008017433,viaf_author_id:61012459,isni:0000000036452181,lccn:lccn-n2008017433","Reedˏ Ellenˏ [Author]","HD30.29","[Relentless Solution Focus: Train Your Mind to Conquer Stress, Pressure, and Underperformance](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333249)

"","","Huston, Therese","Therese Huston","**A game-changing model for giving effective feedback to peers, employees, or even your boss--without offending or demotivating.** How *are* you supposed to tell someone that they're not meeting expectations without crushing their spirit? Regular feedback, when delivered skillfully, can turn average performers into the hardest workers and stars into superstars. Yet many see it as an awkward chore: Recent studies have revealed 37% of managers dread giving feedback, and 65% of employees wish their managers gave more feedback.  This trail-blazing new model eliminates the guesswork. Dr. Therese Huston, the founding director of the Center for Excellence in Teaching and Learning at Seattle University, discovered that the key to being listened to is to listen. First, find out what kind of feedback an employee wants most: appreciation, coaching, or evaluation. If they crave one, they'll be more receptive once their need has been satisfied. Then Huston lays out counterintuitive strategies for delivering each type of feedback successfully, including:  **-** Start by saying your good intentions out loud: it may feel unnecessary, but it makes all the difference.   **-** Side with the person, not the problem: a bad habit or behavior probably is probably less entrenched than you think.   **-** Give reports a chance to correct inaccurate feedback: they want an opportunity to talk more than they want you to be a good talker.  This handbook will make a once-stressful ordeal feel natural, and, by greasing the wheels of regular feedback conversations, help managers improve performance, trust, and mutual understanding.","","658.3145","2021-11-10T22:51:33-08:00","2021-07-27T00:00:00-07:00","Supervision of employees, Employees--Coaching of, Employee motivation, Feedback (Psychology)","","53330230","9780593086629","9780593086629","isbn:9780593086629,goodreads:53330230,google:IrUlEAAAQBAJ,ltid:208333251,oclc-owi:10215164837,oclc:1153020777,lc_authority_name:n2009023782,viaf_author_id:223806170,isni:0000000426622801,lccn:lccn-n2009023782","","BF319.5.F4","[Let's Talk: Make Effective Feedback Your Superpower](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333251)

"","","Véliz, Carissa","Carissa Véliz","An Economist BEST BOOK OF THE YEAR: 'galvanises an important conversation'.  The first book to call for the end of the data economy. Carissa Veliz exposes how our personal data is giving too much to big tech and governments, why that matters, and what we can do about it.Have you ever been denied insurance, a loan, or a job? Have you had your credit card number stolen? Do you have to wait too long when you call customer service? Have you paid more for a product than one of your friends? Have you been harassed online? Have you noticed politics becoming more divisive in your country? You might have the data economy to thank for all that and more. The moment you check your phone in the morning you are giving away your data. Before you've even switched off your alarm, a whole host of organisations have been alerted to when you woke up, where you slept, and with whom. Our phones, our TVs, even our washing machines are spies in our own homes. Without your permission, or even your awareness, tech companies are harvesting your location, your likes, your habits, your relationships, your fears, your medical issues, and sharing it amongst themselves, as well as with governments and a multitude of data vultures. They're not just selling your data. They're selling the power to influence you and decide for you. Even when you've explicitly asked them not to. And it's not just you. It's all your contacts too, all your fellow citizens. Privacy is as collective as it is personal. Digital technology is stealing our personal data and with it our power to make free choices. To reclaim that power, and our democracy, we must take back control of our personal data. Surveillance is undermining equality. We are being treated differently on the basis of our data. What can we do? The stakes are high. We need to understand the power of data better. We need to start protecting our privacy. And we need regulation. We need to pressure our representatives. It is time to pull the plug on the surveillance economy. Insightful, terrifying, practical: Privacy is Power highlights the implications of our laid-back attitude to data and sets out how we can take back control. If you liked The Age of Surveillance Capitalism, you'll love Privacy is Power because it provides a philosophical perspective on the politics of privacy, and offers very practical solutions, both for policymakers and ordinary citizens.'An essential guide to one of the most pressing modern issues.'

Once vast swathes of the globe were coloured imperial red and Britannia ruled not just the waves, but the prairies of America, the plains of Asia, the jungles of Africa and the deserts of Arabia. Just how did a small, rainy island in the North Atlantic achieve all this? And why did the empire on which the sun literally never set finally decline and fall?

"","","Gray, Catherine","Catherine Gray","**Learning how to be exalted by the everyday is the most important lesson we can possibly learn. In Catherine Gray's hilarious, insightful, soulful (and very ordinary) next book, you may learn to do just that.** We're told that happiness is in the extraordinary. It's on a Caribbean sun lounger, in the driving seat of a luxury car, inside an expensive golden locket, watching sunrise from Machu Picchu. We strive, reach, push, shoot for more. 'Enough' is a moving target we never quite reach.  When we do brush our fingertips against the extraordinary a deeply inconvenient psychological phenomenon called the 'hedonic treadmill' means that, after a surge of joy, our happiness level returns to the baseline it was at before the 'extra' event.  So, what's the answer? The Unexpected Joy of the Ordinary theorizes that the solution is rediscovering the joy in the ordinary that we so often now forget to feel. Because we now expect the pleasure of a croissant, a hot shower, a yoga class, someone delivering our shopping to our door, we no longer feel its buzz. The joy of it whips through us like a bullet train, without pause.  Catherine Gray was a grandmaster in the art of eye-rolling the ordinary, and skilled in everlasting reaching. Until the black dog of depression forced her to re-think everything.  Along the way, she discovered some surprising realities about the extraordinaries among us: that influencers risk higher rates of anxiety and depression and high-rollers are less happy.","","158","2021-11-10T22:51:33-08:00","2021-07-22T00:00:00-07:00","Happiness","","45415787","9781783253371","9781783253371","goodreads:45415787,ltid:208333245,google:tF1nwwEACAAJ,isbn:9781783253371,oclc-owi:9576100268,oclc:1089961421","","BF575.H27","[The Unexpected Joy of the Ordinary](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333245)

Understanding the contours of your social network can dramatically enhance personal relationships, work life, and even your global impact. Are you an Expansionist, a Broker, or a Convener? The answer matters more than you think. . . .   Yale professor Marissa King shows how anyone can build more meaningful and productive relationships based on insights from neuroscience, psychology, and network analytics. Conventional wisdom says it's the size of your network that matters, but social science research has proven there is more to it. King explains that the quality and structure of our relationships has the greatest impact on our personal and professional lives. As she shows, there are three basic types of networks, so readers can see the role they are already playing: Expansionist, Broker, or Convener. This network decoder enables readers to own their network style and modify it for better alignment with their life plans and values.  High-quality connections in your social network strongly predict cognitive functioning, emotional resilience, and satisfaction at work. A well-structured network is likely to boost the quality of your ideas, as well as your pay. Beyond the office, social connections are the lifeblood of our health and happiness. The compiled results from dozens of previous studies found that our social relationships have an effect on our likelihood of dying prematurely--equivalent to obesity or smoking.  Rich stories of Expansionists like Vernon Jordan, Brokers like Yo-Yo Ma, and Conveners like Anna Wintour, as well as personal experiences from King's own world of connections, inform this warm, engaging, revelatory investigation into some of the most consequential decisions we can make about the trajectory of our lives.","","302","2021-11-10T22:51:33-08:00","2021-07-13T00:00:00-07:00","Social networks, Interpersonal relations, Social psychology, Social interaction","","48904521","9781524743802","9781524743802","isbn:9781524743802,google:LF4NEAAAQBAJ,goodreads:48904521,ltid:208333811,oclc-owi:9655881039,oclc:1119770547,lc_authority_name:n2019061543,viaf_author_id:13157159857978791493,lccn:lccn-n2019061543","","HM1106","[Social Chemistry: Decoding the Elements of Human Connection](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333811)

"","","Greenblatt, Joel","Joel Greenblatt","In 2005, Joel Greenblatt published a book that is already considered one of the classics of finance literature. In *The Little Book that Beats the Market--* a *New York Times* bestseller with 300,000 copies in print *\--* Greenblatt explained how investors can outperform the popular market averages by simply and systematically applying a formula that seeks out good businesses when they are available at bargain prices. Now, with a new Introduction and Afterword for 2010, *The Little Book that Still Beats the Market* updates and expands upon the research findings from the original book. Included are data and analysis covering the recent financial crisis and model performance through the end of 2009. In a straightforward and accessible style, the book explores the basic principles of successful stock market investing and then reveals the author's time-tested formula that makes buying above average companies at below average prices automatic. Though the formula has been extensively tested and is a breakthrough in the academic and professional world, Greenblatt explains it using 6th grade math, plain language and humor. He shows how to use his method to beat both the market and professional managers by a wide margin. You'll also learn why success eludes almost all individual and professional investors, and why the formula will continue to work even after everyone ""knows"" it. While the formula may be simple, understanding why the formula works is the true key to success for investors. The book will take readers on a step-by-step journey so that they can learn the principles of value investing in a way that will provide them with a long term strategy that they can understand and stick with through both good and bad periods for the stock market.  As the *Wall Street Journal* stated about the original edition, ""Mr. Greenblatt...says his goal was to provide advice that, while sophisticated, could be understood and followed by his five children, ages 6 to 15. They are in luck. His 'Little Book' is one of the best, clearest guides to value investing out there.""","","332.63228","2021-11-10T22:51:33-08:00","2021-07-12T00:00:00-07:00","Speculation, Stock exchanges, Portfolio management, Investments","","8247775","9780470624159","9780470624159","ltid:208333238,google:G5RyDwAAQBAJ,isbn:9780470624159,goodreads:8247775,oclc-owi:3901905247,oclc:671530895,lc_authority_name:n96110875,viaf_author_id:79557042,isni:000000011234946,lccn:lccn-n96110875","","HG6041","[The Little Book That Still Beats the Market](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333238)

"","","Lonergan, Eric & Blyth, Mark","Eric Lonergan & Mark Blyth","Economics increasingly fails to explain why the pressures of life appear to be intensifying at the same time as income per capita is rising, or why we work more hours for less money in real terms. And why we see the rise of nationalism everywhere when globalization, on average, has made us all richer. The disconnect between our experience of the world and the economic model used to explain it has given rise to ""angrynomics"": an economy of heightened uncertainty and anger, where faith in the workings of markets and politics has been undermined and rapid and seemingly ever-accelerating economic change has become something to be feared.  Eric Lonergan and Mark Blyth have written a book for anyone anxious, worried – or angry – about the mismatch between how they experience the world with the increasing day to day pressures they face and the model used by economic elites and politicians to explain and justify it. In a powerful and passionately argued analysis, they bring their critical insight and expertise to bear on the nature of angrynomics and offer a set of radical and innovative policies that cut across tired party political lines – and that if implemented might just help the world to be a less angry place.","","330","2021-11-10T22:51:33-08:00","2021-07-12T00:00:00-07:00","Economics--Political aspects","","48908670","9781788212786","9781788212786","goodreads:48908670,ltid:208333229,google:xjmUygEACAAJ,isbn:9781788212786,oclc-owi:10542236537,oclc:1122741561,lc_authority_name:n2002100994,viaf_author_id:7620941,isni:0000000109519333,lccn:lccn-n2002100994","Blythˏ Mark : 1967- [Author]","HB74.P65","[Angrynomics](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333229)

But, as Guy Winch, Ph.D., points out, these kinds of emotional injuries often get worse when left untreated and can significantly impact our quality of life. In this fascinating and highly practical book he provides the emotional first aid treatments we have been lacking.  Explaining the long-term fallout that can result from seemingly minor emotional and psychological injuries, Dr. Winch offers concrete, easy-to-use exercises backed up by hard cutting-edge science to aid in recovery. He uses relatable anecdotes about real patients he has treated over the years and often gives us a much needed dose of humor as well.  Prescriptive, programmatic, and unique, this first-aid kit for battered emotions will appeal to readers of *Unstuck* by James S. Gordon and *Self-Compassion* by Kristin Neff.","","158.1","2021-11-10T22:51:33-08:00","2021-07-09T00:00:00-07:00","Mental health, Self-help techniques, Emotions, Psychic trauma, Psychic trauma--Treatment","","16158512","9781594631207","9781594631207","ltid:208333241,google:qY21NAEACAAJ,goodreads:16158512,isbn:9781594631207,oclc-owi:3902169299,oclc:828834192,lc_authority_name:n2010037958,viaf_author_id:179544300,isni:0000000356064305,lccn:lccn-n2010037958","","BF632","[Emotional First Aid: Practical Strategies for Treating Failure, Rejection, Guilt, and Other Everyday Psychological Injuries](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333241)

"","","Stout, Martha","Martha Stout","*""When we say a friend was 'like a different person,' we may be more right than we know.""*   -The Boston Globe  Why does a gifted psychiatrist suddenly begin to torment his own beloved wife?  How can a ninety-pound woman carry a massive air conditioner to the second floor of her home, install it in a window unassisted, and then not remember how it got there?  Why would a brilliant feminist law student ask her fiancé to treat her like a helpless little girl?  How can an ordinary, violence-fearing businessman once have been a gun-packing vigilante prowling the crime districts for a fight?  A startling new study in human consciousness, **The Myth of Sanity** is a landmark book about forgotten trauma, dissociated mental states, and multiple personality in everyday life.  In its groundbreaking analysis of childhood trauma and dissociation and their far-reaching implications in adult life, it reveals that moderate dissociation is a normal mental reaction to pain and that even the most extreme dissociative reaction-multiple personality-is more common than we think. Through astonishing stories of people whose lives have been shattered by trauma and then remade, **The Myth of Sanity** shows us how to recognize these altered mental states in friends and family, even in ourselves.  *""We only think we're sane, says this Harvard psychologist...

"","","Lyubomirsky, Sonja","Sonja Lyubomirsky","***Happiness expert Sonja Lyubomirsky’s research-based lessons in how to find opportunity in life’s thorniest moments** *  In *The Myths of Happiness* , Sonja Lyubomirsky isolates the major turning points of adult life, looking to both achievements (marriage, children, professional satisfaction, wealth) and failures (singlehood, divorce, financial ruin, illness) to reveal that our misconceptions about the impact of such events is perhaps the greatest threat to our long-term well-being.  Lyubomirsky argues that we have been given false promises—myths that assure us that lifelong happiness will be attained once we hit the culturally confirmed markers of adult success. This restricted view of happiness works to discourage us from recognizing the upside of any negative life turn and blocks us from recognizing our own growth potential. Our outsized expectations transform natural rites of passage into emotional land mines and steer us to make toxic decisions, as *The Myths of Happiness* reveals.  Because we expect the best (or the worst) from life’s turning points, we shortsightedly place too much weight on our initial emotional responses. *The Myths of Happiness* empowers readers to look beyond their first response, sharing scientific evidence that often it is our mindset—not our circumstances—that matters. Central to these findings is the notion of hedonic adaptation, the fact that people are far more adaptable than they think. Even after a major life change—good or bad—we tend to return to our initial happiness level, forgetting what once made us elated or why we felt that life was so unbearable. *The Myths of Happiness* offers the perspective we need to make wiser choices, sharing how to slow the effects of this adaptation after a positive turn and find the way forward in a time of darkness.  In *The Myths of Happiness* , Sonja Lyubomirsky turns an empirical eye to the biggest, messiest moments, providing readers with the clear-eyed vision they need to build the healthiest, most satisfying life. A corrective course on happiness and a call to regard life’s twists and turns with a more open mind, *The Myths of Happiness* shares practical lessons with life-changing potential.","","152.42","2021-11-10T22:51:33-08:00","2021-07-05T00:00:00-07:00","Happiness, Conduct of life, Optimism","","15811501","9781594204371","9781594204371","isbn:9781594204371,goodreads:15811501,ltid:208333221,oclc-owi:4915291404,oclc:796756303,lc_authority_name:n2007070324,viaf_author_id:28283277,isni:0000000058087162,lccn:lccn-n2007070324","","BF575.H27","[The Myths of Happiness](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333221)

"","","Sinek, Simon","Simon Sinek","**Why do you do what you do?** Why are some people and organizations more innovative, more influential, and more profitable than others? Why do some command greater loyalty from customers and employees alike? Even among the successful, why are so few able to repeat their success over and over?  People like Martin Luther King Jr., Steve Jobs, and the Wright Brothers might have little in common, but they all *started with why*. It was their natural ability to start with why that enabled them to inspire those around them and to achieve remarkable things.  In studying the leaders who've had the greatest influence in the world, Simon Sinek discovered that they all think, act, and communicate in the exact same way—and it's the complete opposite of what everyone else does. Sinek calls this powerful idea The Golden Circle, and it provides a framework upon which organizations can be built, movements can be lead, and people can be inspired. And it all starts with WHY.  Any organization can explain *what* it does; some can explain *how* they do it; but very few can clearly articulate *why*. WHY is not money or profit—those are always results. WHY does your organization exist? WHY does it do the things it does? WHY do customers really buy from one company or another? WHY are people loyal to some leaders, but not others?  Starting with WHY works in big business and small business, in the nonprofit world and in politics. Those who start with WHY never manipulate, they inspire. And the people who follow them don't do so because they have to; they follow because they want to.  Drawing on a wide range of real-life stories, Sinek weaves together a clear vision of what it truly takes to lead and inspire. This book is for anyone who wants to inspire others or who wants to find someone to inspire them.","","658.4092","2021-11-10T22:51:33-08:00","2021-07-04T00:00:00-07:00","Leadership, Success in business","","7108725","9781591842804","9781591842804","google:tUaNDQAAQBAJ,ltid:208333235,goodreads:7108725,isbn:9781591842804,oclc-owi:815263438,oclc:373054685,viaf_author_id:287617597,isni:000000036892814","Walsmitˏ Vanja [Translator], Gonsaˏ Christian [Translator; Other]","HD57.7","[Start With Why: How Great Leaders Inspire Everyone to Take Action](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333235)

System 1 is fast, intuitive, and emotional; System 2 is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. The impact of overconfidence on corporate strategies, the difficulties of predicting what will make us happy in the future, the profound effect of cognitive biases on everything from playing the stock market to planning our next vacation—each of these can be understood only by knowing how the two systems shape our judgments and decisions.Engaging the reader in a lively conversation about how we think, Kahneman reveals where we can and cannot trust our intuitions and how we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking. He offers practical and enlightening insights into how choices are made in both our business and our personal lives—and how we can use different techniques to guard against the mental glitches that often get us into trouble.

And while this message may not seem stunningly original or fresh, Tolle's clear writing, supportive voice and enthusiasm make this an excellent manual for anyone who's ever wondered what exactly ""living in the now"" means. Foremost, Tolle is a world-class teacher, able to explain complicated concepts in concrete language. More importantly, within a chapter of reading this book, readers are already holding the world in a different container--more conscious of how thoughts and emotions get in the way of their ability to live in genuine peace and happiness. Tolle packs a lot of information and inspirational ideas into *The Power of Now*.

"","","Brown, Brené","Brené Brown","**In her #1 NYT bestsellers, Brené Brown taught us what it means to dare greatly, rise strong and brave the wilderness. Now, based on new research conducted with leaders, change makers and culture shifters, she’s showing us how to put those ideas into practice so we can step up and lead.** Leadership is not about titles, status and power over people. Leaders are people who hold themselves accountable for recognising the potential in people and ideas, and developing that potential. This is a book for everyone who is ready to choose courage over comfort, make a difference and lead.  When we dare to lead, we don't pretend to have the right answers; we stay curious and ask the right questions. We don't see power as finite and hoard it; we know that power becomes infinite when we share it and work to align authority and accountability. We don't avoid difficult conversations and situations; we lean into the vulnerability that’s necessary to do good work.  But daring leadership in a culture that's defined by scarcity, fear and uncertainty requires building courage skills, which are uniquely human. The irony is that we're choosing not to invest in developing the hearts and minds of leaders at the same time we're scrambling to figure out what we have to offer that machines can't do better and faster. *What can we do better?* Empathy, connection and courage to start.  Brené Brown spent the past two decades researching the emotions that give meaning to our lives. Over the past seven years, she found that leaders in organisations ranging from small entrepreneurial start-ups and family-owned businesses to non-profits, civic organisations and Fortune 50 companies, are asking the same questions:  **How do you cultivate braver, more daring leaders? And, how do you embed the** **value of courage in your culture?** *Dare to Lead* answers these questions and gives us actionable strategies and real examples from her new research-based, courage-building programme.  Brené writes, ‘One of the most important findings of my career is that courage can be taught, developed and measured. Courage is a collection of four skill sets supported by twenty-eight behaviours. All it requires is a commitment to doing bold work, having tough conversations and showing up with our whole hearts. Easy? No. Choosing courage over comfort is not easy. Worth it? Always. We want to be brave with our lives and work. It's why we're here.’","","658.4092","2021-11-10T22:51:33-08:00","2021-06-26T00:00:00-07:00","Leadership, Business, Success in business, Executive ability, Corporate culture, Transformational leadership","","40109367","9781473562523","9781473562523","google:JdlbDwAAQBAJ,ltid:208333319,isbn:9781473562523,goodreads:40109367,oclc-owi:5105484799,oclc:1035397956,lc_authority_name:n2012027764,viaf_author_id:240588731,lccn:lccn-n2012027764","Beusekomˏ Bonella Vanˏ [Translator], Liaoˏ Jianrong [Translator]","HD57.7","[Dare to Lead](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333319)

"","","Kleon, Austin","Austin Kleon","In his *New York Times* bestseller *Steal Like an Artist* , Austin Kleon showed readers how to unlock their creativity by “stealing” from the community of other movers and shakers. Now, in an even more forward-thinking and necessary book, he shows how to take that critical next step on a creative journey—getting known.  *Show Your Work!* is about why generosity trumps genius. It’s about getting *findable* , about using the network instead of wasting time “networking.” It’s not self-promotion, it’s self-discovery—let others into your process, then let them steal from you. Filled with illustrations, quotes, stories, and examples, *Show Your Work!* offers ten transformative rules for being open, generous, brave, productive.  In chapters such as **You Don’t Have to Be a Genius** ; **Share Something Small Every Day** ; and **Stick Around** , Kleon creates a user’s manual for embracing the communal nature of creativity— what he calls the “ecology of talent.” From broader life lessons about work (you can’t find your voice if you don’t use it) to the etiquette of sharing—and the dangers of oversharing—to the practicalities of Internet life (build a good domain name; give credit when credit is due), it’s an inspiring manifesto for succeeding as any kind of artist or entrepreneur in the digital age.","","650.1","2021-11-10T22:51:33-08:00","2021-06-24T00:00:00-07:00","Success in business, Business networks, Career development, Communication in design, Design","","18290401","9780761178972","9780761178972","isbn:9780761178972,google:NFOLAgAAQBAJ,ltid:208333223,goodreads:18290401,oclc-owi:1375126671,oclc:855607405,lc_authority_name:no2010076777,viaf_author_id:121212929,isni:0000000079653653,lccn:lccn-no2010076777","Mosaik Verlag [Publisher], Fleglerˏ Leena [Translator]","HF5381","[Show Your Work!: 10 Ways to Share Your Creativity and Get Discovered](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333223)

You know how it goes; it sounds a lil something like this:&quot;Go to school, get a good job, save 10% of your paycheck, buy a used car, cancel the movie channels, quit drinking expensive Starbucks mocha lattes, save and penny-pinch your life away, trust your life-savings to the stock market, and one day, when you are oh, say, 65 years old, you can retire rich.&quot;The mainstream financial gurus have sold you blindly down the river to a great financial gamble: You&#39;ve been hoodwinked to believe that wealth can be created by recklessly trusting in the uncontrollable and unpredictable markets: the housing market, the stock market, and the job market. This impotent financial gamble dubiously promises wealth in a wheelchair -- sacrifice your adult life for a financial plan that reaps dividends in the twilight of life. Accept the Slowlane as your blueprint for wealth and your financial future will blow carelessly asunder on a sailboat of HOPE: HOPE you can find a job and keep it, HOPE the stock market doesn&#39;t tank, HOPE the economy rebounds, HOPE, HOPE, and HOPE. Do you really want HOPE to be the centerpiece for your family&#39;s financial plan?Drive the Slowlane road and you will find your life deteriorate into a miserable exhibition about what you cannot do, versus what you can. For those who don&#39;t want a lifetime subscription to &quot;settle-for-less&quot; and a slight chance of elderly riches, there is an alternative; an expressway to extraordinary wealth that can burn a trail to financial independence faster than any road out there.Why jobs, 401(k)s, mutual funds, and 40-years of mindless frugality will never make you rich young. Why most entrepreneurs fail and how to immediately put the odds in your favor. The real law of wealth: Leverage this and wealth has no choice but to be magnetized to you.The leading cause of poorness: Change this and you change everything.How the rich really get rich - and no, it has nothing to do with a paycheck or a 401K match.Why the guru&#39;s grand deity - compound interest - is an impotent wealth accelerator.Why the guru myth of &quot;do what you love&quot; will most likely keep you poor, not rich. And 250+ more poverty busting distinctions...Demand the Fastlane, an alternative road-to-wealth; one that actually ignites dreams and creates millionaires young, not old.

Apparently he has a girlfriend named Piper, and his best friend is a guy named Leo. They’re all students at the Wilderness School, a boarding school for “bad kids,"" as Leo puts it. What did Jason do to end up here? And where *is* here, exactly? Jason doesn't know anything—except that everything seems very wrong.  **PIPER HAS A SECRET.** Her father has been missing for three days, ever since she had that terrifying nightmare about his being in trouble. Piper doesn’t understand her dream, or why her boyfriend suddenly doesn’t recognize her. When a freak storm hits during the school trip, unleashing strange creatures and whisking her, Jason, and Leo away to someplace called Camp Half-Blood, she has a feeling she’s going to find out, whether she wants to or not.  **LEO HAS A WAY WITH TOOLS.** When he sees his cabin at Camp Half-Blood, filled with power tools and machine parts, he feels right at home. But there’s weird stuff, too—like the curse everyone keeps talking about, and some camper who's gone missing. Weirdest of all, his bunkmates insist that each of them—including Leo—is related to a *god*. Does this have anything to do with Jason's amnesia, or the fact that Leo keeps seeing ghosts?  Join new and old friends from Camp Half-Blood in this thrilling first book in The Heroes of Olympus series.

Laplante","A NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER  “Brilliant and enthralling.”​ —The Wall Street Journal A paradigm-shifting book from an acclaimed Harvard Medical School scientist and one of Time’s most influential people.It’s a seemingly undeniable truth that aging is inevitable. But what if everything we’ve been taught to believe about aging is wrong? What if we could choose our lifespan? In this groundbreaking book, Dr. David Sinclair, leading world authority on genetics and longevity, reveals a bold new theory for why we age. As he writes: “Aging is a disease, and that disease is treatable.” This eye-opening and provocative work takes us to the frontlines of research that is pushing the boundaries on our perceived scientific limitations, revealing incredible breakthroughs—many from Dr. David Sinclair’s own lab at Harvard—that demonstrate how we can slow down, or even reverse, aging. The key is activating newly discovered vitality genes, the descendants of an ancient genetic survival circuit that is both the cause of aging and the key to reversing it. Recent experiments in genetic reprogramming suggest that in the near future we may not just be able to feel younger, but actually become younger. Through a page-turning narrative, Dr. Sinclair invites you into the process of scientific discovery and reveals the emerging technologies and simple lifestyle changes—such as intermittent fasting, cold exposure, exercising with the right intensity, and eating less meat—that have been shown to help us live younger and healthier for longer. At once a roadmap for taking charge of our own health destiny and a bold new vision for the future of humankind, Lifespan will forever change the way we think about why we age and what we can do about it.","","570","2021-11-10T22:51:33-08:00","2021-06-16T00:00:00-07:00","Longevity, Life spans (Biology), Aging, Aging--Prevention","","43723901","9781501191978","9781501191978","goodreads:43723901,google:x--oDwAAQBAJ,isbn:9781501191978,ltid:208333211,oclc-owi:8949840443,oclc:1088652276,lc_authority_name:ns2020000291,viaf_author_id:39154074367111740050,isni:0000000072117233,lccn:lccn-ns2020000291","Sinclairˏ David A 1969-, Laplanteˏ Matthew D [Author], Delphiaˏ Catherine [Illustrator]","QH528.5","[Lifespan: Why We Age—and Why We Don't Have To](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333211)

"","","Grant, Adam M.","Adam M. Grant","#1 New York Times Bestseller  ""THIS. This is the right book for right now. Yes, learning requires focus. But, unlearning and relearning requires much more--it requires choosing courage over comfort. In Think Again, Adam Grant weaves together research and storytelling to help us build the intellectual and emotional muscle we need to stay curious enough about the world to actually change it. I've never felt so hopeful about what I don't know."" --Brené Brown, Ph.D., #1 New York Times bestselling author of Dare to Lead  ""Think Again is a must-read for anyone who wants to create a culture of learning and exploration, whether at home, at work, or at school... In an increasingly divided world, the lessons in this book are more important than ever."" -Bill and Melinda Gates  The bestselling author of Give and Take and Originals examines the critical art of rethinking: learning to question your opinions and open other people's minds, which can position you for excellence at work and wisdom in life  Intelligence is usually seen as the ability to think and learn, but in a rapidly changing world, there's another set of cognitive skills that might matter more: the ability to rethink and unlearn. In our daily lives, too many of us favor the comfort of conviction over the discomfort of doubt. We listen to opinions that make us feel good, instead of ideas that make us think hard. We see disagreement as a threat to our egos, rather than an opportunity to learn. We surround ourselves with people who agree with our conclusions, when we should be gravitating toward those who challenge our thought process. The result is that our beliefs get brittle long before our bones. We think too much like preachers defending our sacred beliefs, prosecutors proving the other side wrong, and politicians campaigning for approval--and too little like scientists searching for truth. Intelligence is no cure, and it can even be a curse: being good at thinking can make us worse at rethinking. The brighter we are, the blinder to our own limitations we can become.  Organizational psychologist Adam Grant is an expert on opening other people's minds--and our own. As Wharton's top-rated professor and the bestselling author of Originals and Give and Take, he makes it one of his guiding principles to argue like he's right but listen like he's wrong. With bold ideas and rigorous evidence, he investigates how we can embrace the joy of being wrong, bring nuance to charged conversations, and build schools, workplaces, and communities of lifelong learners. You'll learn how an international debate champion wins arguments, a Black musician persuades white supremacists to abandon hate, a vaccine whisperer convinces concerned parents to immunize their children, and Adam has coaxed Yankees fans to root for the Red Sox. Think Again reveals that we don't have to believe everything we think or internalize everything we feel. It's an invitation to let go of views that are no longer serving us well and prize mental flexibility over foolish consistency. If knowledge is power, knowing what we don't know is wisdom.","","153.42","2021-11-10T22:51:33-08:00","2021-06-15T00:00:00-07:00","Questioning, Thought and thinking, Belief and doubt, Knowledge; Theory of","","55539565","9781984878106","9781984878106","google:UhkSEAAAQBAJ,isbn:9781984878106,ltid:208333284,goodreads:55539565,oclc-owi:11425469422,oclc:1153485373,lc_authority_name:n2012065680,viaf_author_id:274149386,isni:0000000384165277,lccn:lccn-n2012065680","","BF441","[Think Again: The Power of Knowing What You Don't Know](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333284)

"","","Crosby, Daniel","Daniel Crosby","From the New York Times bestselling author of the book named the best investment book of 2017 comes The Behavioral Investor, an applied look at how psychology ought to inform the art and science of investment management. Joint Gold medallist at the Axiom Business Book Awards 2019 - Personal Finance / Retirement Planning / Investing. In The Behavioral Investor, psychologist and asset manager Dr. Daniel Crosby examines the sociological, neurological and psychological factors that influence our investment decisions and sets forth practical solutions for improving both returns and behavior. Readers will be treated to the most comprehensive examination of investor behavior to date and will leave with concrete solutions for refining decision-making processes, increasing self-awareness and constraining the fatal flaws to which most investors are prone. The Behavioral Investor takes a sweeping tour of human nature before arriving at the specifics of portfolio construction, rooted in the belief that it is only as we come to a deep understanding of ""why"" that we are left with any clue as to ""how"" we ought to invest. The book is comprised of three parts, which are as follows: - Part One - An explication of the sociological, neurological and physiological impediments to sound investment decision-making. Readers will leave with an improved understanding of how externalities impact choices in nearly imperceptible ways and begin to understand the impact of these pressures on investment selection. - Part Two - Coverage of the four primary psychological tendencies that impact investment behavior. Although human behavior is undoubtedly complex, in an investment context our choices are largely driven by one of the four factors discussed herein. Readers will emerge with an improved understanding of their own behavior, increased humility and a lens through which to vet decisions of all types. - Part Three - Illuminates the ""so what"" of Parts One and Two and provides a framework for managing wealth in a manner consistent with the realities of our contextual and behavioral shortcomings. Readers will leave with a deeper understanding of the psychological underpinnings of popular investment approaches such as value and momentum and appreciate why all types of successful investing have psychology at their core. Wealth, truly considered, has at least as much to do with psychological as financial wellbeing. The Behavioral Investor aims to enrich readers in the most holistic sense of the word, leaving them with tools for compounding both wealth and knowledge.","","332.6019","2021-11-10T22:51:33-08:00","2021-06-13T00:00:00-07:00","Portfolio management, Capitalists and financiers--Decision making, Investments--Decision making, Investments--Psychological aspects, Business","","36960014","9780857196866","9780857196866","ltid:208333210,isbn:9780857196866,isni:000000005903699,google:B6jLswEACAAJ,lccn:lccn-no2009063272,lc_authority_name:no2009063272,viaf_author_id:86394880,oclc-owi:5490829441,goodreads:36960014,oclc:1057366054","Crosbyˏ Daniel : 1979-","HG4515.15","[The Behavioral Investor](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333210)

By doing this, we can simplify and make life even better- *San Francisco Book Review* Dalton’s ground-up approach to productivity teaches readers to identify their real priorities and, in doing so, cut their massive to-do lists down to size by learning to say no to the tasks that pull them away from their North Star- *Grateful* *** * *Overwhelmed.*** Do you wake up in the morning already feeling behind?

Now Find Your Why picks up where Start With Why left off. It shows you how to apply Simon Sinek's powerful insights so that you can find more inspiration at work -- and in turn inspire those around you.  I believe fulfillment is a right and not a privilege. We are all entitled to wake up in the morning inspired to go to work, feel safe when we're there and return home fulfilled at the end of the day. Achieving that fulfillment starts with understanding exactly WHY we do what we do.   As Start With Why has spread around the world, countless readers have asked me the same question: How can I apply Start With Why to my career, team, company or nonprofit? Along with two of my colleagues, Peter Docker and David Mead, I created this hands-on, step-by-step guide to help you find your WHY.  With detailed exercises, illustrations, and action steps for every stage of the process, Find Your Why can help you address many important concerns, including:  * What if my WHY sounds just like my competitor's? * Can I have more than one WHY? * If my work doesn't match my WHY, what should I do? * What if my team can't agree on our WHY?  Whether you've just started your first job, are leading a team, or are CEO of your own company, the exercises in this book will help guide you on a path to long-term success and fulfillment, for both you and your colleagues.

Hall & Joshua Miller","**From the author of *Die Empty* and *The Accidental Creative* , a new framework for understanding what motivates us and why.** * * * What drives us to unleash our best work? And how do we tap into that drive to get superior results with our managers, coworkers, and direct reports? As Todd Henry reveals in this illuminating book, drawing on decades of research and interviews with over 100,000 people, the answer is not one size fits all: some people are energized by a race against the clock, while others put in extra effort only when they feel part of a team. For still others, nothing is as motivating as the possibility of public recognition.  Henry shows, in fact, that there are twenty-seven motivational themes"", each with its own unique DNA. For instance:  \- Those driven to **Achieve Potential** strive to build an ideal future, even when others may not see as far ahead.    \- Those needing to **Overcome** must conquer whatever obstacles come their way, no matter how difficult or time-consuming.    \- Those who strive to **Comprehend and Express** are obsessed with mastering new skills and showing off what they know--which is often a lot.   \- Those who want to **Make It Right** thrive when systems are running smoothly and usually know the proper way to do things.  *The Motivation Code* teaches us to decode our Core Motivation so that we can have conversations, make decisions, and even choose career paths that lead us to experience engagement and fulfillment. Once we know how to activate our inner drivers, we can transform the work we do into work we love.","","650.1019","2021-11-10T22:51:33-08:00","2021-06-03T00:00:00-07:00","Employee motivation, Job satisfaction","","50608282","9780593191651","9780593191651","isbn:9780593191651,goodreads:50608282,ltid:208333204,google:uA38DwAAQBAJ,oclc-owi:10215127036,oclc:1136958724,lc_authority_name:n2011005759,viaf_author_id:67146634453141931994,isni:0000000113044131,lccn:lccn-n2011005759","Hallˏ Todd W [Author], Pennerˏ Rod [Author]","HF5549.5.M63","[The Motivation Code: Discover the Hidden Forces That Drive Your Best Work](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333204)

She called it The Financial Diet because she didn’t want to keep treating her financial health the way she was treating her body—by eating an entire bag of jalapeño kettle chips at night and then wondering why she felt terrible the next morning. Today, the blog has grown into a vibrant web community—one where money is finally interesting to talk about. The Financial Diet will be a savvy older sister, a trusted friend, and the girl at the office who always seems to have her sh*t together. It also brings in money experts who really know their stuff to help you make the best choices for your financial health. The Financial Diet gives you tools to make a budget, consider investments, and deal with your credit. But, The Financial Diet also understands that being smarter with money isn’t just about what you put in the bank; it’s about everything from the clothes you put in your closet to the food you put in your kitchen (instead of ordering in . . . again). The book includes quick and cheap recipes, tricks to give your wardrobe longevity, and affordable DIY projects for your home. It also tackles how happiness and love relate to financial success, gives you tips about negotiating a raise, and shares the perfect cocktail recipe to celebrate your new salary. The Financial Diet is the only diet that works—it will cut the junk out of your life and your wallet, get your finances in shape, and empower you to want to talk about money as much as you want to talk about sex. Beautifully designed, and full of relatable humor, The Financial Diet takes everything that makes the site a unique destination and turns it into the book every smart, successful woman has to have on her shelf.","","332.024","2021-11-10T22:51:34-08:00","2021-05-28T00:00:00-07:00","Women--Finance; Personal, Finance; Personal","","32927009","9781682450574","9781682450574","ltid:208333202,google:D1s1vgAACAAJ,goodreads:32927009,isbn:9781682450574,oclc-owi:3930617317,oclc:962016866,lc_authority_name:n2017049681,viaf_author_id:956150323773709971048,lccn:lccn-n2017049681","Ver Hageˏ Lauren [Designer; Author; Book Designer], Mobleyˏ Eve [Illustrator]","HG179","[The Financial Diet](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333202)

"","","Mendelson, B. J.","B. J. Mendelson","*A provocative look at social media that dispels the hype and tells you all you need to know about using the Web to expand your business*   **   ** If you listen to the pundits, Internet gurus, marketing consultants, and even the mainstream media, you could think social media was the second coming. When it comes to business, they declare that it's revolutionizing advertising, PR, customer relations—everything. And they all agree: it is here to stay.  In this lively, insightful guide, journalist and social critic B.J. Mendelson skillfully debunks the myths of social media. He illustrates how the notion of ""social media"" first came to prominence, why it has become such a powerful presence in the marketing field, and who stands to benefit each time it's touted in the press. He shows you why all the Facebook friends and Twitter followers in the world mean nothing to you and your business without old-fashioned, real-world connections. He examines popular tales of social media ""success,"" and reveals some unsettling truths behind the surface. And he tells you how to best harness the potential of the Internet—without spending a fortune in the process.  Social media is bullshit. This book gives the knowledge and tools you *really* need to connect with customers and grow your brand.","","302.231","2021-11-10T22:51:34-08:00","2021-05-26T00:00:00-07:00","Marketing, Social media","","13539184","9781250002952","9781250002952","isbn:9781250002952,ltid:208333185,google:mWZcZrgcqZEC,goodreads:13539184,oclc-owi:1170056327,oclc:779265047,lc_authority_name:n2012038780,viaf_author_id:250990231,isni:0000000371405075,lccn:lccn-n2012038780","","HM742","[Social Media Is Bullshit](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333185)

Bennett & Sarah Bennett","The only self-help book you'll ever need, from a psychiatrist and his comedy writer daughter, who will help you put aside your unrealistic wishes, stop trying to change things you can't change, and do the best with what you can control—the first steps to managing all of life's impossible problems.Need to stop screwing up? Feel like you're under a loser's curse? Work with an ass? Want to clear your name or get justice, rescue an addicted person, get closure after childhood abuse, get a lover to commit, not ruin your kid? Although other self-help books claim to reveal the path to happiness, F*ck Feelings warns that convincing yourself that there is such a path will actually lead you to feel like a true failure. What the Bennetts can promise you is that you can manage any situation life throws at you if you can keep your sense of humor, bend your wishes to fit reality, restrain your feelings, manage bad behavior, and do what you think is right.Life is hard. It's not fair. Our feelings cloud our rationality, and we become tangled in our efforts to achieve the impossible or change the unchangeable.

But The ADHD Advantage explodes this outlook, showing that some of the most highly successful entrepreneurs, leaders, and entertainers have reached the pinnacle of success not in spite of their ADHD but because of it. Simply put, ADHD is a diagnosis of boredom. Although the ADHD stereotype is someone who can't sit still, in reality people with ADHD are endlessly curious, often adventurous, willing to take smart risks, and unusually resilient. They are creative, visionary, and entrepreneurial. Sharing the stories of highly successful people with ADHD, Dr. Archer offers a vitally important and inspiring new way to recognize ADHD traits in oneself or in one's loved ones, and then leverage them to great advantage?without drugs. As someone who not only has ADHD himself but also has never used medication to treat it, Dr. Archer understands the condition from a unique standpoint. Armed with new science and research, he hopes to generate public interest and even debate with his positive message as he guides the millions of people with ADHD worldwide toward a whole new appreciation of their many strengths and full innate potential.","","618.928589","2021-11-10T22:51:34-08:00","2021-05-22T00:00:00-07:00","Self-care; Health, Success, Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder","","23398983","9781594633515","9781594633515","isbn:9781594633515,goodreads:23398983,google:LvMBDAAAQBAJ,ltid:208333180,oclc-owi:2484612812,oclc:893895112,lc_authority_name:n2011036517,viaf_author_id:171366685,lccn:lccn-n2011036517","","RJ506.H9","[The ADHD Advantage: What You Thought Was a Diagnosis May Be Your Greatest Strength](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333180)

Can't turn off your brain? Curious about mindfulness but more comfortable in the gym? This book is for you.  You'll also get access to guided audio meditations on the 10% Happier app, to jumpstart your practice from day one.  ABC News anchor Dan Harris used to think that meditation was for people who collect crystals, play Ultimate Frisbee, and use the word ""namaste"" without irony. After he had a panic attack on live television, he went on a strange and circuitous journey that ultimately led him to become one of meditation's most vocal public proponents.  Harris found that meditation made him more focused and less yanked around by his emotions. According to his wife, it also made him less annoying. Science suggests that the practice can lower your blood pressure, mitigate depression and anxiety, and literally rewire key parts of the brain. So what's holding you back?  In Meditation for Fidgety Skeptics, Harris and Jeff Warren, a masterful teacher and ""Meditation MacGyver,"" embark on a gonzo cross-country quest to tackle the myths, misconceptions, and self-deceptions that keep people from meditating. It is filled with game-changing and deeply practical meditation instructions--all of which are also available (for free) on the 10% Happier app. This book is a trip worth taking.

"","","Burkus, David","David Burkus","""Leading from Anywhere is the best book on remote work I've ever read--incisive, original, and eminently practical. Read it--and take notes!""--Daniel H. Pink, author of When, Drive, and To Sell Is Human  The ultimate guide to leading remote teams, tackling the key challenges that managers face--from hiring and onboarding new members from afar to building culture remotely, tracking productivity, communicating speedily, and avoiding burnout   It's undeniable that we're entering a new era of remote work. While many leaders seek to run business as usual, why settle for the usual when remote teams allow us to work even better? The research shows that employees are more productive and engaged when they have the freedom to work from anywhere.  Which means leaders need the skills to lead from anywhere.  In this meticulously researched, refreshingly practical book, top business thought leader David Burkus provides managers with the field guide to leading remotely, packed with everyday examples and illuminating insights. Structured around the life cycle of working on a team, Burkus tackles the key inflection points and challenges that remote managers face, from taking the team remote and adding new members to communicating effectively and quickly, managing performance, keeping the team engaged, and even helping them strike the right balance between work and life. Leading from Anywhere provides everything you'll need to survive and thrive as the leader of a remote team--something all leaders will need to consider themselves from now on.","","658.4022","2021-11-10T22:51:34-08:00","2021-05-16T00:00:00-07:00","Leadership, Virtual reality in management, Virtual work teams--Management","","54271712","9780358533276","9780358533276","lc_authority_name:n2013033383,isbn:9780358533276,goodreads:54271712,google:4P4GEAAAQBAJ,lccn:lccn-n2013033383,oclc-owi:10564917636,viaf_author_id:304223908,oclc:1198988983,ltid:208333179,isni:0000000409995534","Burkusˏ David : 1983-","HD30.2122","[Leading From Anywhere: The Essential Guide to Managing Remote Teams](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333179)

What if they know that in order to achieve success, they will sometimes have to do things that others may initially perceive as stupid? The fact of the matter is that the smartest people in the world don’t run from stupid, they lean into it (in a smart way).  In The Power of Starting Something Stupid, Richie Norton redefines stupid as we know it, demonstrating that life-changing ideas are often tragically mislabeled “stupid.” What if the key to success, creativity, and fulfillment in your life lies in the potential of those “stupid” ideas? This deeply inspiring book will teach you  -How to crush fear, make dreams happen, and live without regret.  -How to overcome obstacles such as lack of time, lack of education, or lack of money.  -The 5 actions of the New Smart to achieve authentic success. No more excuses.  Learn how to start something stupid—the smartest thing you can do.  Drawing on years of research, including hundreds of face-to-face interviews and some of the world’s greatest success stories past and present, Richie shows you how stupid is the New Smart—the common denominator for success, creativity, and innovation in business and life.","","650.1","2021-11-10T22:51:34-08:00","2021-05-09T00:00:00-07:00","Success in business, Creative ability in business","","15895556","9781609070090","9781609070090","isbn:9781609070090,goodreads:15895556,ltid:208333169,google:_wQ8LgEACAAJ,oclc-owi:1118130513,oclc:794706777,lc_authority_name:no2013032155,viaf_author_id:275089054,isni:0000000384368349,lccn:lccn-no2013032155","Nortonˏ Natalie [Author]","HF5386","[The Power of Starting Something Stupid: How to Crush Fear, Make Dreams Happen, and Live Without Regret](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333169)

"","","Newport, Cal","Cal Newport","In this eye-opening account, Cal Newport debunks the long-held belief that ""follow your passion"" is good advice.  Not only is the cliché flawed-preexisting passions are rare and have little to do with how most people end up loving their work-but it can also be dangerous, leading to anxiety and chronic job hopping.  After making his case against passion, Newport sets out on a quest to discover the reality of how people end up loving what they do. Spending time with organic farmers, venture capitalists, screenwriters, freelance computer programmers, and others who admitted to deriving great satisfaction from their work, Newport uncovers the strategies they used and the pitfalls they avoided in developing their compelling careers.  Matching your job to a preexisting passion does not matter, he reveals. Passion comes after you put in the hard work to become excellent at something valuable, not before. In other words, what you do for a living is much less important than how you do it.  With a title taken from the comedian Steve Martin, who once said his advice for aspiring entertainers was to ""be so good they can't ignore you,"" Cal Newport's clearly written manifesto is mandatory reading for anyone fretting about what to do with their life, or frustrated by their current job situation and eager to find a fresh new way to take control of their livelihood. He provides an evidence-based blueprint for creating work you love.  *So Good They Can't Ignore You* will change the way we think about our careers, happiness, and the crafting of a remarkable life.","","650.1","2021-11-10T22:51:34-08:00","2021-05-07T00:00:00-07:00","Vocational guidance, Personality and occupation","","13525945","9781455509102","9781455509102","goodreads:13525945,google:ZW_coFi_h1QC,isbn:9781455509102,ltid:208333178,oclc-owi:1044084589,oclc:760904847,lc_authority_name:n2004101272,viaf_author_id:1827152684006823430003,isni:0000000378709880,lccn:lccn-n2004101272","","HF5381","[So Good They Can't Ignore You: Why Skills Trump Passion in the Quest for Work You Love](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333178)

"","","Gawande, Atul","Atul Gawande","**The *New York Times* bestselling author of *Better* and *Complications* reveals the surprising power of the ordinary checklist** We live in a world of great and increasing complexity, where even the most expert professionals struggle to master the tasks they face. Longer training, ever more advanced technologies‚neither seems to prevent grievous errors. But in a hopeful turn, acclaimed surgeon and writer Atul Gawande finds a remedy in the humblest and simplest of techniques: the checklist.  First introduced decades ago by the U.S. Air Force, checklists have enabled pilots to fly aircraft of mind-boggling sophistication. Now innovative checklists are being adopted in hospitals around the world, helping doctors and nurses respond to everything from flu epidemics to avalanches. Even in the immensely complex world of surgery, a simple ninety-second variant has cut the rate of fatalities by more than a third.  In riveting stories, Gawande takes us from Austria, where an emergency checklist saved a drowning victim who had spent half an hour underwater, to Michigan, where a cleanliness checklist in intensive care units virtually eliminated a type of deadly hospital infection. He explains how checklists actually work to prompt striking and immediate improvements. And he follows the checklist revolution into fields well beyond medicine, from homeland security to investment banking, skyscraper construction, and businesses of all kinds.  An intellectual adventure in which lives are lost and saved and one simple idea makes a tremendous difference, *The Checklist Manifesto* is essential reading for anyone working to get things right.","","610.289","2021-11-10T22:51:34-08:00","2021-05-06T00:00:00-07:00","Lists, Medical care--Quality control, Organizational effectiveness, Success in business, Creative thinking, Medical care--Standards, Medical care, Surgery","","6667514","9780805091748","9780805091748","ltid:208333175,goodreads:6667514,isbn:9780805091748,oclc-owi:795705362,oclc:465378674,lc_authority_name:n2001016329,viaf_author_id:121901025,isni:0000000080444875,lccn:lccn-n2001016329","","RA399.A1","[The Checklist Manifesto: How to Get Things Right](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333175)

"","","Plutarch & Beneker, Jeffrey","Plutarch & Jeffrey Beneker","**Timeless advice on how to be a successful leader in any field** The ancient biographer and essayist Plutarch thought deeply about the leadership qualities of the eminent Greeks and Romans he profiled in his famous--and massive-- *Lives* , including politicians and generals such as Pericles, Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar, and Mark Antony. Luckily for us, Plutarch distilled what he learned about wise leadership in a handful of essays, which are filled with essential lessons for experienced and aspiring leaders in any field today. In *How to Be a Leader,* Jefferey Beneker presents the most important of these essays in lively new translations accompanied by an enlightening introduction, informative notes, and the original Greek on facing pages.  In ""To an Uneducated Leader,"" ""How to Be a Good Leader,"" and ""Should an Old Man Engage in Politics?"" Plutarch explains the characteristics of successful leaders, from being guided by reason and exercising self-control to being free from envy and the love of power, illustrating his points with memorable examples drawn from legendary Greco-Roman lives. He also explains how to train for leadership, persuade and deal with colleagues, manage one's career, and much more.  Writing at the height of the Roman Empire, Plutarch suggested that people should pursue positions of leadership only if they are motivated by ""judgment and reason""--not ""rashly inspired by the vain pursuit of glory, a sense of rivalry, or a lack of other meaningful activities."" His wise counsel remains as relevant as ever.","","873.01","2021-11-10T22:51:34-08:00","2021-05-05T00:00:00-07:00","Plutarch, Leadership","","45358692","9780691192116","9780691192116","google:jciXDwAAQBAJ,isbn:9780691192116,goodreads:45358692,ltid:208333171,oclc-owi:10200577869,oclc:1129956629","Plutarqueˏ (0046?-0120?)","PA4368","[How to Be a Leader: An Ancient Guide to Wise Leadership](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333171)

"","","Bailey, Chris","Chris Bailey","****Canada's productivity expert returns with a totally fresh angle on how to do more with less.* * ** Throughout his experiments and research, Chris Bailey came across many little-known insights into how we focus (a key element of productivity), including the surprising idea that focus isn't so much a state of heightened awareness (as we'd assume), but a balance between two frames of mind. The most recent neuroscientific research on attention reveals that our brain has two powerful modes that can be unlocked when we use our attention well: a focused mode (hyperfocus), which is the foundation for being highly productive, and a creative mode (scatterfocus), which enables us to connect ideas in novel ways. *Hyperfocus* helps readers unlock both, so they can concentrate more deeply, think more clearly, and work and live more deliberately. Diving deep into the science and theories about how and why we bring our attention to bear on life's big goals and everyday tasks, Chris Bailey takes his unique approach to productivity to the next level in *Hyperfocus,* while retaining the approachable voice and perspective that made him a fast favourite.","","153.733","2021-11-10T22:51:34-08:00","2021-05-04T00:00:00-07:00","Time management, Distraction (Psychology), Attention, Self-management (Psychology), Industrial productivity","","36959766","9780735273689","9780735273689","google:ApOfswEACAAJ,ltid:208333164,goodreads:36959766,isbn:9780735273689,oclc-owi:5194808852,oclc:1030279222,lc_authority_name:n2015038632,viaf_author_id:316548283,isni:0000000450499049,lccn:lccn-n2015038632","Baileyˏ Chris : 1989-","BF637.T5","[Hyperfocus: How to Be More Productive in a World of Distraction](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333164)

"","","Akerlof, George A. & Shiller, Robert J.","George A. Akerlof & Robert J. Shiller","**Why the free-market system encourages so much trickery even as it creates so much good** Ever since Adam Smith, the central teaching of economics has been that free markets provide us with material well-being, as if by an invisible hand. In *Phishing for Phools* , Nobel Prize-winning economists George Akerlof and Robert Shiller deliver a fundamental challenge to this insight, arguing that markets harm as well as help us. As long as there is profit to be made, sellers will systematically exploit our psychological weaknesses and our ignorance through manipulation and deception. Rather than being essentially benign and always creating the greater good, markets are inherently filled with tricks and traps and will phish us as phools.  *Phishing for Phools* therefore strikes a radically new direction in economics, based on the intuitive idea that markets both give and take away. Akerlof and Shiller bring this idea to life through dozens of stories that show how phishing affects everyone, in almost every walk of life. We spend our money up to the limit, and then worry about how to pay the next month's bills. The financial system soars, then crashes. We are attracted, more than we know, by advertising. Our political system is distorted by money. We pay too much for gym memberships, cars, houses, and credit cards. Drug companies ingeniously market pharmaceuticals that do us little good, and sometimes are downright dangerous.  *Phishing for Phools* explores the central role of manipulation and deception in fascinating detail in each of these areas and many more. It thereby explains a paradox: why, at a time when we are better off than ever before in history, all too many of us are leading lives of quiet desperation. At the same time, the book tells stories of individuals who have stood against economic trickery--and how it can be reduced through greater knowledge, reform, and regulation.","","330.019","2021-11-10T22:51:34-08:00","2021-04-21T00:00:00-07:00","Economics--Psychological aspects","","25560530","9780691168319","9780691168319","goodreads:25560530,google:x2BPrgEACAAJ,ltid:208333158,isbn:9780691168319,lc_authority_name:n82241976,viaf_author_id:84577765,isni:0000000109206185,lccn:lccn-n82241976,oclc-owi:9426567951,oclc:1158992697","Akerlofˏ George A : 1940-, Shillerˏ Robert J [Author], Akerlofˏ George A : 1940- [Author]","HB74.P8","[Phishing for Phools: The Economics of Manipulation and Deception](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333158)

But there are also aspects of life that truly allow us to be joyful and fulfilled. For popular podcaster and bestselling author Annie F. Downs, fun is close to the top of that list. Few would argue that having fun doesn't enrich our lives, but so much gets in the way of prioritizing it. Tough days, busyness, and feelings that are hard to talk about keep us from the fun that's out there waiting to be found.  With *That Sounds Fun* , Annie offers an irresistible invitation to understand the meaning of fun, to embrace it and chase it, and to figure out what, exactly, sounds fun to you--then do it! Exploring some research and sharing some thoughts behind why fun matters, she shows you how to find, experience, and multiply your fun.

"","","Savage, Dan","Dan Savage","Non tutti i bisogni sessuali possono essere soddisfatti. Non tutte le esigenze sessuali devono essere soddisfatte.    Ma anche se non si può avere il sesso dei propri sogni, anche se avete appetiti che il vostro partner non può soddisfare, essere ascoltati non è chiedere troppo.  «SOLO QUANDO OGNUNO DI NOI SARÀ DAVVERO LIBERO, SOLO ALLORA AVREMO VINTO TUTTI.»  Uno dei giornalisti di costume più amati    racconta cosa significa essere gay    e sentirsi liberi di affermare se stessi    come esseri umani  Cosa definisce una società libera? Il rispetto della propria natura e delle proprie idee, siano esse politiche, religiose o esistenziali. Ma gli Stati Uniti, casa degli uomini liberi e delle opportunità, sono in grado di garantire questo pluralismo delle diversità? Dan Savage affronta il tema della libertà ripercorrendo la sua storia personale e i suoi duelli ideologici con repubblicani corazzati e omofobi convinti. La cultura statunitense non ha un’origine ma un’evoluzione da rispettare. I matrimoni, tutti i matrimoni, vanno protetti: non esistono «classifiche», non esistono generalizzazioni che tengano. La società deve basarsi sull’amore, non su un tipo di amore specifico.  Essere gay non è una questione di sesso, è una questione di libertà, di quanto la manifestazione genuina di un sentimento reciproco sia giusta in sé, indipendentemente dal contesto: solo così la natura vince sull’ambiente, gli slanci del cuore superano i meccanismi dell’evoluzione. Tutte le argomentazioni in questo senso passano attraverso l’analisi di una «fenomenologia statunitense»: dettami dei fondamentalisti cristiani (astinenza sessuale, razzismo, pro-vita), politica (famiglia, matrimoni, assistenza sanitaria) e senso comune (omofobia, uso di armi). Un viaggio coast to coast nella vita degli americani, raccontato con brillanti capacità argomentative e quel senso dell’ironia e del dissacrante che hanno reso Dan Savage una firma conosciuta in tutto il mondo.","","306.7662092","2021-11-10T22:51:34-08:00","2021-04-13T00:00:00-07:00","United States, Savage; Dan, Gay men, Gays","","16101100","9780525954101","9780525954101","google:2o32nQEACAAJ,isni:0000000371402317,oclc:1020150557,lc_authority_name:n98044899,viaf_author_id:251043971,lccn:lccn-n98044899,ltid:208333163,oclc-owi:1174663370,goodreads:16101100,isbn:9780525954101","","HQ75.8.S28","[American Savage: Insights, Slights, and Fights on Faith, Sex, Love, and Politics](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333163)

She became an icon because of her remarkable wisdom as a leader. As the co-captain of the 2015 Women’s World Cup Champion Team, she created a culture not just of excellence, but of honor, commitment, resilience, and sisterhood.

By the author of the new book, Rationality. Is the world really falling apart? Is the ideal of progress obsolete? In this elegant assessment of the human condition in the third millennium, cognitive scientist and public intellectual Steven Pinker urges us to step back from the gory headlines and prophecies of doom, which play to our psychological biases. Instead, follow the data: In seventy-five jaw-dropping graphs, Pinker shows that life, health, prosperity, safety, peace, knowledge, and happiness are on the rise, not just in the West, but worldwide. This progress is not the result of some cosmic force. It is a gift of the Enlightenment: the conviction that reason and science can enhance human flourishing. Far from being a naïve hope, the Enlightenment, we now know, has worked. But more than ever, it needs a vigorous defense. The Enlightenment project swims against currents of human nature--tribalism, authoritarianism, demonization, magical thinking--which demagogues are all too willing to exploit. Many commentators, committed to political, religious, or romantic ideologies, fight a rearguard action against it. The result is a corrosive fatalism and a willingness to wreck the precious institutions of liberal democracy and global cooperation. With intellectual depth and literary flair, Enlightenment Now makes the case for reason, science, and humanism: the ideals we need to confront our problems and continue our progress.","","303.44","2021-11-10T22:51:34-08:00","2021-04-11T00:00:00-07:00","Civilization; Modern, Progress, Social change, Quality of life, Humanism, Reason, Enlightenment","","35696171","9780525427575","9780525427575","isbn:9780525427575,google:hf9MDwAAQBAJ,goodreads:35696171,ltid:208333153,oclc-owi:4765047024,oclc:993692045,lc_authority_name:n82245455,viaf_author_id:108149508,isni:0000000121468153,lccn:lccn-n82245455","Pinkerˏ Steven : 1954-","HM891","[Enlightenment Now: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333153)

"","","Moore, Don A.","Don A. Moore","**An expert on the psychology of decision making at Berkeley’s Haas School of Business considers how to calibrate examines the importance of being confident, arguing that confidence is good, but overconfidence can hinder growth.** A surge of confidence can feel fantastic—offering a rush of energy, even a dazzling vision of the future. It can give us courage and bolster our determination when facing adversity. But if that self-assurance leads us to pursue impossible goals, it can waste time, money, and energy. Self-help books and motivational speakers tell us that the more confident we are, the better. But this way of thinking can lead to enormous trouble.  Decades of research demonstrates that we often have an over-inflated sense of self and are rarely as good as we believe. *Perfectly Confident* is the first book to bring together the best psychological and economic studies to explain exactly what confidence is, when it can be helpful, and when it can be destructive in our lives.  Confidence is an attitude that takes into account both personal feelings and the facts. Don Moore identifies the ways confidence behaves in real life and raises thought-provoking questions. How optimistic should you be about an uncertain future? What justifies your confidence in something amorphous and subjective like your attractiveness or sense of humor?  Moore reminds us that the key to success is to avoid being both over- and under-confident. In this essential guide, he shows how to become perfectly confident—how to strive for and maintain the well-calibrated, adaptive confidence that can elevate all areas of our lives.","","658.45","2021-11-10T22:51:34-08:00","2021-04-11T00:00:00-07:00","Communication in management, Confidence","","49946989","9780062887771","9780062887771","goodreads:49946989,google:CminDwAAQBAJ,ltid:208333160,isbn:9780062887771,oclc-owi:9441593640,oclc:1128890379,lc_authority_name:n2004102353,viaf_author_id:60941323,isni:0000000036395148,lccn:lccn-n2004102353","Mooreˏ Don A : 1970-","HD30.3","[Perfectly Confident: How to Calibrate Your Decisions Wisely](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333160)

It's easy to blame the economy or the financial markets-but the real trouble lies in the decisions we make. As a financial planner, Carl Richards grew frustrated watching people he cared about make the same mistakes over and over. They were letting emotion get in the way of smart financial decisions. He named this phenomenon-the distance between what we should do and what we actually do-""the behavior gap."" Using simple drawings to explain the gap, he found that once people understood it, they started doing much better. Richards's way with words and images has attracted a loyal following to his blog posts for ""The New York Times,"" appearances on National Public Radio, and his columns and lectures. His book will teach you how to rethink all kinds of situations where your perfectly natural instincts (for safety or success) can cost you money and peace of mind. He'll help you to:    avoid the tendency to buy high and sell low; avoid the pitfalls of generic financial advice; invest all of your assets-time and energy as well as savings-more wisely; quit spending money and time on things that don't matter; identify your real financial goals; start meaningful conversations about money; simplify your financial life; stop losing money It's never too late to make a fresh financial start. As Richards writes: ""We've all made mistakes, but now it's time to give yourself permission to review those mistakes, identify your personal behavior gaps, and make a plan to avoid them in the future. The goal isn't to make the 'perfect' decision about money every time, but to do the best we can and move forward. Most of the time, that's enough.""","","332.024","2021-11-10T22:58:27-08:00","2021-09-10T00:00:00-07:00","Portfolio management, Finance; Personal, Investments","","13487424","9781591844648","9781591844648","ltid:208333167,goodreads:13487424,barnesnoble:w/behavior-gap-carl-richards/1102829647,viaf_author_id:179612015,lccn:lccn-n2011057386,lc_authority_name:n2011057386,oclc:729341502,isni:0000000356087996,isbn:9781591844648,google:nnV8vgEACAAJ,oclc-owi:1077086360","Richardsˏ Carl : 1972-","HG179","[The Behavior Gap](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333167)

"","","Ferriss, Timothy & Schwarzenegger, Arnold","Timothy Ferriss & Arnold Schwarzenegger (foreword By)","The latest groundbreaking tome from Tim Ferriss, the #1 New York Times best-selling author of The 4-Hour Workweek. From the author:   ""For the last two years, I've interviewed more than 200 world-class performers for my podcast, The Tim Ferriss Show. The guests range from super celebs (Jamie Foxx, Arnold Schwarzenegger, etc.) and athletes (icons of powerlifting, gymnastics, surfing, etc.) to legendary Special Operations commanders and black-market biochemists. For most of my guests, it's the first time they've agreed to a two-to-three-hour interview. This unusual depth has helped make The Tim Ferriss Show the first business/interview podcast to pass 100 million downloads.  ""This book contains the distilled tools, tactics, and 'inside baseball' you won't find anywhere else. It also includes new tips from past guests, and life lessons from new 'guests' you haven't met.  ""What makes the show different is a relentless focus on actionable details. This is reflected in the questions. For example: What do these people do in the first sixty minutes of each morning? What do their workout routines look like, and why? What books have they gifted most to other people? What are the biggest wastes of time for novices in their field? What supplements do they take on a daily basis?  ""I don't view myself as an interviewer. I view myself as an experimenter. If I can't test something and replicate results in the messy reality of everyday life, I'm not interested.  ""Everything within these pages has been vetted, explored, and applied to my own life in some fashion. I've used dozens of the tactics and philosophies in high-stakes negotiations, high-risk environments, or large business dealings. The lessons have made me millions of dollars and saved me years of wasted effort and frustration.  ""I created this book, my ultimate notebook of high-leverage tools, for myself. It's changed my life, and I hope the same for you.""","","081","2021-11-10T22:58:27-08:00","2021-05-16T00:00:00-07:00","Success, Self-actualization (Psychology), Change (Psychology), Physical fitness, Successful people, Wealth, Self-realization, Wisdom","","31823677","9781328683786","9781328683786","google:M77RDwAAQBAJ,isbn:9781328683786,barnesnoble:w/tools-of-titans-tim-ferriss/1124512855,goodreads:31823677,ltid:208333298,oclc-owi:3850801478,oclc:953223137,lc_authority_name:n79085101,viaf_author_id:64196027,isni:000000012136715,lccn:lccn-n79085101","Geoffroiˏ Remie [Illustrator], Otero Piñeiroˏ Dulcinea [Translator]","BF637.S8","[Tools of Titans: The Tactics, Routines, and Habits of Billionaires, Icons, and World-Class Performers](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333298)

It caused a riot. Now he finally sets down his philosophy in detail. And he practises what he preaches: he hasn't read the news for a decade.* Stop Reading the News* is Dobelli's manifesto about the dangers of the most toxic form of information - news. He shows the damage it does to our concentration and well-being, and how a misplaced sense of duty can misdirect our behaviour. From the author of the bestselling *The Art of Thinking Clearly* , Rolf Dobelli's book offers the reader guidance about how to live without news, and the many potential gains to be had: less disruption, more time, less anxiety, more insights. In a world of increasing disruption and division, *Stop Reading the News* is a welcome voice of calm and wisdom.","","070.43","2021-11-10T22:58:27-08:00","2021-05-31T00:00:00-07:00","Press, Self-actualization (Psychology), Thought and thinking, Broadcast journalism","","48581422","9781529342727","9781529342727","isbn:9781529342727,goodreads:48581422,barnesnoble:w/stop-reading-the-news-rolf-dobelli/1136014656,amazon:B07SD5TPP1,ltid:208333287,oclc-owi:9927680001,oclc:1127091992,lc_authority_name:no2004035295,viaf_author_id:34759894,isni:0000000078476093,lccn:lccn-no2004035295","Dobelliˏ Rolf : 1966-","PN4731","[Stop Reading the News: A Manifesto for a Happier, Calmer and Wiser Life](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333287)

"","","Riordan, Rick","Rick Riordan","The Blood of Olympus is the fifth book in the bestselling Heroes of Olympus series - set in the high-octane world of Percy Jackson.Though the Greek and Roman crew members of the Argo II have made progress in their many quests, they still seem no closer to defeating the earth mother, Gaea. Her giants have risen - all of them - and they're stronger than ever. They must be stopped before the Feast of Spes, when Gaea plans to have two demigods sacrificed in Athens. She needs their blood -the blood of Olympus - in order to wake. The demigods are having more frequent visions of a terrible battle at Camp Half-Blood. The Roman legion from Camp Jupiter, led by Octavian, is almost within striking distance. Though it is tempting to take the Athena Parthenos to Athens to use as a secret weapon, the friends know that the huge statue belongs back on Long Island, where it might be able to stop a war between the two camps. The Athena Parthenos will go west; the Argo II will go east.The gods, still suffering from multiple personality disorder, are useless. How can a handful of young demigods hope to persevere against Gaea's army of powerful giants? As dangerous as it is to head to Athens, they have no other option. They have sacrificed too much already. And if Gaea wakes, it is game over...Rick Riordan has now sold an incredible 55 million copies of his books worldwide'A cracking read' - Sunday Express'Explosive' - Big Issue'Action-packed' - Telegraph","","FIC","2021-11-10T22:58:27-08:00","2021-08-18T00:00:00-07:00","Mythology; Greek, Gaia (Greek deity), Mythology; Roman, Jackson; Percy (Fictitious character), Quests (Expeditions), Camps, Gods; Greek, Friendship","","18889300","9780141339238","9780141339238","google:hUJzAwAAQBAJ,goodreads:18889300,ltid:208333257,isbn:9780141339238,oclc-owi:1784644071,oclc:881318207,lc_authority_name:no97039491,viaf_author_id:60214017,isni:0000000109066661,lccn:lccn-no97039491","Gómez Calvoˏ Ignacio [Translator]","PZ7.R4829","[The Blood of Olympus (Heroes of Olympus Book 5)](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333257)

"","","Brown, Brené","Brené Brown","The #1 New York Times bestseller. More than 2 million copies sold! Look for Brené Brown's new podcast, Dare to Lead,  as well as her ongoing podcast Unlocking Us! From thought leader Brené Brown, a transformative new vision for the way we lead, love, work, parent, and educate that teaches us the power of vulnerability.  ""It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; . . . who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly.""--Theodore Roosevelt Every day we experience the uncertainty, risks, and emotional exposure that define what it means to be vulnerable or to dare greatly. Based on twelve years of pioneering research, Brené Brown PhD, MSW, dispels the cultural myth that vulnerability is weakness and argues that it is, in truth, our most accurate measure of courage. Brown explains how vulnerability is both the core of difficult emotions like fear, grief, and disappointment, and the birthplace of love, belonging, joy, empathy, innovation, and creativity. She writes: ""When we shut ourselves off from vulnerability, we distance ourselves from the experiences that bring purpose and meaning to our lives.""  Daring Greatly is not about winning or losing. It's about courage. In a world where ""never enough"" dominates and feeling afraid has become second nature, vulnerability is subversive. Uncomfortable. It's even a little dangerous at times. And, without question, putting ourselves out there means there's a far greater risk of getting criticized or feeling hurt. But when we step back and examine our lives, we will find that nothing is as uncomfortable, dangerous, and hurtful as standing on the outside of our lives looking in and wondering what it would be like if we had the courage to step into the arena--whether it's a new relationship, an important meeting, the creative process, or a difficult family conversation. Daring Greatly is a practice and a powerful new vision for letting ourselves be seen.","","158","2021-11-10T22:58:27-08:00","2021-08-30T00:00:00-07:00","Assertiveness (Psychology), Courage, Risk, Vulnerability (Personality trait), Risk-taking (Psychology), Self-actualization (Psychology)","","16089813","9781592407330","9781592407330","ltid:208333240,google:K4naCwAAQBAJ,isbn:9781592407330,goodreads:16089813,barnesnoble:w/daring-greatly-brene-brown/1111117601,oclc-owi:1122412014,oclc:779263434,viaf_author_id:285587153,isni:0000000368793847","Horstˏ Marijke Van Der [Translator], Randow-Teschˏ Margaretheˏ [Translator]","BF575.A85","[Daring Greatly: How the Courage to Be Vulnerable Transforms the Way We Live, Love, Parent, and Lead](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333240)

"","","Flynn, Gillian","Gillian Flynn","***NEW YORK TIMES* BESTSELLER • Gillian Flynn’s Edgar Award-winning homage to the classic ghost story, published for the first time as a standalone.** A canny young woman is struggling to survive by perpetrating various levels of mostly harmless fraud. On a rainy April morning, she is reading auras at Spiritual Palms when Susan Burke walks in. A keen observer of human behavior, our unnamed narrator immediately diagnoses beautiful, rich Susan as an unhappy woman eager to give her lovely life a drama injection. However, when the ""psychic"" visits the eerie Victorian home that has been the source of Susan’s terror and grief, she realizes she may not have to pretend to believe in ghosts anymore. Miles, Susan’s teenage stepson, doesn’t help matters with his disturbing manner and grisly imagination. The three are soon locked in a chilling battle to discover where the evil truly lurks and what, if anything, can be done to escape it.  “The Grownup,” which originally appeared as “What Do You Do?” in George R. R. Martin’s *Rogues* anthology, proves once again that Gillian Flynn is one of the world’s most original and skilled voices in fiction.","","813.6","2021-11-10T22:58:27-08:00","2021-10-10T00:00:00-07:00","Psychics, Fraud, Ghost stories, Stepchildren, Haunted houses","","26041948","0804188971","0804188971","ff:f/gillian-flynn/grownup,goodreads:26041948,isbn:0804188971,barnesnoble:w/the-grownup-gillian-flynn/1122609778,ltid:208333186,oclc-owi:2779186457,oclc:918929962,lc_authority_name:n2005086885,viaf_author_id:103168327,isni:0000000114791438,lccn:lccn-n2005086885","Flynnˏ Gillian : 1971-, Palmerˏ Óscar [Translator], Shiˏ Qingzhen : 1965- [Translator]","PS3606.L935","[The Grownup](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333186)

In order to regain his place on Mount Olympus, Lester must restore five Oracles that have gone dark. But he has to achieve this impossible task without having any godly powers and while being duty-bound to a confounding young daughter of Demeter named Meg. *Thanks a lot, Dad.* With the help of some demigod friends, Lester managed to survive his first two trials, one at Camp Half-Blood, and one in Indianapolis, where Meg received the Dark Prophecy. The words she uttered while seated on the Throne of Memory revealed that an evil triumvirate of Roman emperors plans to attack Camp Jupiter. While Leo flies ahead on Festus to warn the Roman camp, Lester and Meg must go through the Labyrinth to find the third emperor—and an Oracle who speaks in word puzzles—somewhere in the American Southwest. There is one glimmer of hope in the gloom-filled prophecy: *The cloven guide alone the way does know*.

"","","McRaven, Admiral William H.","Admiral William H. McRaven","Based on a Navy SEAL's inspiring graduation speech, this #1 New York Times bestseller of powerful life lessons ""should be read by every leader in America"" (Wall Street Journal). If you want to change the world, start off by making your bed. On May 17, 2014, Admiral William H. McRaven addressed the graduating class of the University of Texas at Austin on their Commencement day. Taking inspiration from the university's slogan, ""What starts here changes the world,"" he shared the ten principles he learned during Navy Seal training that helped him overcome challenges not only in his training and long Naval career, but also throughout his life; and he explained how anyone can use these basic lessons to change themselves-and the world-for the better. Admiral McRaven's original speech went viral with over 10 million views. Building on the core tenets laid out in his speech, McRaven now recounts tales from his own life and from those of people he encountered during his military service who dealt with hardship and made tough decisions with determination, compassion, honor, and courage. Told with great humility and optimism, this timeless book provides simple wisdom, practical advice, and words of encouragement that will inspire readers to achieve more, even in life's darkest moments.

Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results No matter your goals, Atomic Habits offers a proven framework for improving--every day. James Clear, one of the world's leading experts on habit formation, reveals practical strategies that will teach you exactly how to form good habits, break bad ones, and master the tiny behaviors that lead to remarkable results. If you're having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn't you. The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don't want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change. You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems. Here, you'll get a proven system that can take you to new heights. Clear is known for his ability to distill complex topics into simple behaviors that can be easily applied to daily life and work. Here, he draws on the most proven ideas from biology, psychology, and neuroscience to create an easy-to-understand guide for making good habits inevitable and bad habits impossible. Along the way, readers will be inspired and entertained with true stories from Olympic gold medalists, award-winning artists, business leaders, life-saving physicians, and star comedians who have used the science of small habits to master their craft and vault to the top of their field. Learn how to:  - make time for new habits (even when life gets crazy); - overcome a lack of motivation and willpower; - design your environment to make success easier; - get back on track when you fall off course;...and much more. Atomic Habits will reshape the way you think about progress and success, and give you the tools and strategies you need to transform your habits--whether you are a team looking to win a championship, an organization hoping to redefine an industry, or simply an individual who wishes to quit smoking, lose weight, reduce stress, or achieve any other goal.","","155.24","2021-11-10T22:58:27-08:00","2021-05-17T00:00:00-07:00","Habit breaking, Behavior modification, Habit","","40121378","9780735211292","9780735211292","ltid:208333295,barnesnoble:w/atomic-habits-james-clear/1129201155,google:XfFvDwAAQBAJ,isbn:9780735211292,amazon:B07D23CFGR,goodreads:40121378,oclc-owi:11165649274,oclc:1043389440,lc_authority_name:no2018147316,viaf_author_id:44154135791715082666,isni:0000000476485390,lccn:lccn-no2018147316","","BF335","[Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333295)

"","B07DBRBP7G","Newport, Cal","Cal Newport","A New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Publishers Weekly, and USA Today bestseller  ""Newport is making a bid to be the Marie Kondo of technology: someone with an actual plan for helping you realize the digital pursuits that do, and don't, bring value to your life.""--Ezra Klein, Vox  Minimalism is the art of knowing how much is just enough. Digital minimalism applies this idea to our personal technology. It's the key to living a focused life in an increasingly noisy world.  In this timely and enlightening book, the bestselling author of Deep Work introduces a philosophy for technology use that has already improved countless lives.  Digital minimalists are all around us. They're the calm, happy people who can hold long conversations without furtive glances at their phones. They can get lost in a good book, a woodworking project, or a leisurely morning run. They can have fun with friends and family without the obsessive urge to document the experience. They stay informed about the news of the day, but don't feel overwhelmed by it. They don't experience ""fear of missing out"" because they already know which activities provide them meaning and satisfaction.  Now, Newport gives us a name for this quiet movement, and makes a persuasive case for its urgency in our tech-saturated world. Common sense tips, like turning off notifications, or occasional rituals like observing a digital sabbath, don't go far enough in helping us take back control of our technological lives, and attempts to unplug completely are complicated by the demands of family, friends and work. What we need instead is a thoughtful method to decide what tools to use, for what purposes, and under what conditions.  Drawing on a diverse array of real-life examples, from Amish farmers to harried parents to Silicon Valley programmers, Newport identifies the common practices of digital minimalists and the ideas that underpin them. He shows how digital minimalists are rethinking their relationship to social media, rediscovering the pleasures of the offline world, and reconnecting with their inner selves through regular periods of solitude. He then shares strategies for integrating these practices into your life, starting with a thirty-day ""digital declutter"" process that has already helped thousands feel less overwhelmed and more in control.  Technology is intrinsically neither good nor bad. The key is using it to support your goals and values, rather than letting it use you. This book shows the way.","","","2021-11-10T22:58:27-08:00","2021-06-19T00:00:00-07:00","","","40672036","9780525536512","9780525536512","barnesnoble:w/digital-minimalism-cal-newport/1129616011,goodreads:40672036,google:1eGCDwAAQBAJ,amazon:B07DBRBP7G,isbn:9780525536512,ltid:208333283,oclc-owi:8941758585,oclc:1192462234","","","[Digital Minimalism: Choosing a Focused Life in a Noisy World](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333283)

"","","Young, Scott & Clear, James","Scott Young & James Clear (foreword By)","Future-proof your career and maximize your competitive advantage by learning the skill necessary to stay relevant, reinvent yourself, and adapt to whatever the workplace throws your way in this essential guide that goes beyond the insights of popular works such as Extreme Productivity, Deep Work, Peak, and Make It Stick.Faced with tumultuous economic times and rapid technological change, staying ahead in your career depends on continual learning—a lifelong mastery of new ideas, subjects, and skills. If you want to accomplish more and stand apart from everyone else, you need to become an ultralearner. In this essential book, Scott Young incorporates the latest research about the most effective learning methods and the stories of other ultralearners like himself—among them Ben Franklin and Richard Feynman, as well as a host of others, such as little-known modern polymaths like Alexander Arguelles, who speaks more than forty languages.Young documents the methods he and others have used and shows that, far from being an obscure skill limited to aggressive autodidacts, ultralearning is a powerful tool anyone can use to improve their career, studies, and life. Ultralearning explores this fascinating subculture, shares the seven principles behind every successful ultralearning project, and offers insights into how you can organize and execute a plan to learn anything deeply and quickly, without teachers or budget-busting tuition costs.Whether the goal is to be fluent in a language (or ten languages), earn the equivalent of a college degree in a fraction of the time, or master multiple skills to build a product or business from the ground up, the principles in Ultralearning will guide you to success.","","650.1","2021-11-10T22:58:27-08:00","2021-08-29T00:00:00-07:00","Vocational guidance, Career development, Learning, Success","","44770129","9780062852687","9780062852687","isbn:9780062852687,ltid:208333244,barnesnoble:w/ultralearning-scott-young/1130636797,goodreads:44770129,google:d0IdvgEACAAJ,oclc-owi:9439571891,oclc:1064714967,lc_authority_name:no2019114252,viaf_author_id:60156563586123242227,lccn:lccn-n88605672","","HF5381","[Ultralearning: Master Hard Skills, Outsmart the Competition, and Accelerate Your Career](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333244)

In The Science of Storytelling, award-winning writer and acclaimed teacher of creative writing Will Storr applies dazzling psychological research and cutting-edge neuroscience to our myths and archetypes to show how we can write better stories, revealing, among other things, how storytellers—and also our brains—create worlds by being attuned to moments of unexpected change.Will Storr’s superbly chosen examples range from Harry Potter to Jane Austen to Alice Walker, Greek drama to Russian novels to Native American folk tales, King Lear to Breaking Bad to children’s stories. With sections such as “The Dramatic Question,” “Creating a World,” and “Plot, Endings, and Meaning,” as well as a practical, step-by-step appendix dedicated to “The Sacred Flaw Approach,” The Science of Storytelling reveals just what makes stories work, placing it alongside such creative writing classics as John Yorke’s Into the Woods: A Five-Act Journey into Story and Lajos Egri’s The Art of Dramatic Writing.

Most people assume a good pitch is a flashy, elaborate affair with dozens of talking points and beautiful slides that needs to be at least 20 minutes long. Brant Pinvidic says that's absolutely untrue- all you need to be taken seriously is three minutes.  Brant is one of the most successful producers in Hollywood, having sold more than 300 TV and movie projects. From Bar Rescue to The Biggest Loser, he has convinced risk-averse studios to turn over their money for his ideas - not by using his charm (though he is pretty charming), or by calling his ideas the greatest things since sliced bread (though they are pretty great).  Instead, he uses a simple, straightforward system called the WHAC method to boil any idea down to its most essential components, and structure it for maximum impact. By answering the questions- ""What is it? How does it work? Are you sure? Can you do it?"" you can weave your most crucial points into a compelling narrative structure and use the power of storytelling in any setting and at any level.  It's a method that's helped Brant sell each of his projects in no more than 3 minutes. But it's not just good for pitching Hollywood! Brant shows you how the same method has helped everyone from Fortune 100 CEOs to PTA presidents. It's helped plumbers sell home restoration systems, lawyers win cases, and oil drillers sell stock, and it's going to help you, too.","","658.45","2021-11-10T22:58:27-08:00","2021-04-25T00:00:00-07:00","Success in business, Business communication, Business presentations, Entrepreneurship","","49351774","9780525540724","9780525540724","isbn:9780525540724,barnesnoble:w/the-3-minute-rule-brant-pinvidic/1132012081,google:W0CzDwAAQBAJ,ltid:208333147,amazon:B07MJZKZYJ,goodreads:49351774,oclc-owi:9341338642,oclc:1104854655,lc_authority_name:no2017157902,viaf_author_id:155148521854520850042,isni:000000049891984,lccn:lccn-no2017157902","","HF5718.22","[The 3-Minute Rule: Say Less to Get More From Any Pitch or Presentation](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333147)

Now, two science professors give us the tools to dismantle misinformation and think clearly in a world of fake news and bad data.  ""A modern classic . . . a straight-talking survival guide to the mean streets of a dying democracy and a global pandemic.""--Wired Misinformation, disinformation, and fake news abound and it's increasingly difficult to know what's true. Our media environment has become hyperpartisan. Science is conducted by press release. Startup culture elevates bullshit to high art. We are fairly well equipped to spot the sort of old-school bullshit that is based in fancy rhetoric and weasel words, but most of us don't feel qualified to challenge the avalanche of new-school bullshit presented in the language of math, science, or statistics. In Calling Bullshit, Professors Carl Bergstrom and Jevin West give us a set of powerful tools to cut through the most intimidating data.  You don't need a lot of technical expertise to call out problems with data. Are the numbers or results too good or too dramatic to be true? Is the claim comparing like with like? Is it confirming your personal bias? Drawing on a deep well of expertise in statistics and computational biology, Bergstrom and West exuberantly unpack examples of selection bias and muddled data visualization, distinguish between correlation and causation, and examine the susceptibility of science to modern bullshit.  We have always needed people who call bullshit when necessary, whether within a circle of friends, a community of scholars, or the citizenry of a nation. Now that bullshit has evolved, we need to relearn the art of skepticism.","","149.73","2021-11-10T22:58:27-08:00","2021-09-20T00:00:00-07:00","Skepticism, Critical thinking--Study and teaching, Statistics, Big data","","50711098","9780525509202","9780525509202","barnesnoble:w/calling-bullshit-carl-bergstrom/1134846884,google:v-UlEAAAQBAJ,isbn:9780525509202,goodreads:50711098,ltid:208333212,oclc-owi:9958512241,oclc:1127668193,lc_authority_name:no2011071482,viaf_author_id:170866527,lccn:lccn-no2011071482","Westˏ Jevin D 1977- [Author], Bergstromˏ Carl T [Author]","B837","[Calling Bullshit: The Art of Skepticism in a Data-Driven World](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333212)

"","B088P3LNRJ","McNeff, David J.","David J. McNeff","An empowering guide that will show you how to shed the myth of the “work-life balance” by merging the seven key components that make up your life to attain harmony and whole-life success “All of us have Seven Slices in our lives: our Family Slice, our Professional Slice, our Personal Slice, our Physical Slice, our Intellectual Slice, our Emotional Slice, and our Spiritual Slice. These all need to be served in some fashion—and in serving them, they, in turn, serve us.” This relatively simple but profoundly critical concept is at the heart of the method executive coach David McNeff has used to transform the lives and careers of his clients. It begins with two important facts: 1) stress happens—you can’t avoid it; and 2) your existence is composed of far more than “work” and “life.” Too often, we divide our lives into those two general categories, but we’re all a lot more complex and our lives are richer than that. By being clear and mindful of all aspects of your life—the Seven Slices—you’ll be more likely to find inner harmony when stress impacts one of them. In The Work-Life Balance Myth, McNeff takes you on a deep dive into each of the Seven Slices, explaining the components of each Slice, signs that you may not be attending to each Slice in a healthy way, and hands-on methods for accessing an underserved Slice. The Work-Life Balance Myth won’t make your life perfect—no one can do that, and you shouldn’t trust anyone who makes that promise. What this book will do is provide you with proven new ways of framing your life, seeing stress for what it is, and vastly improving your ability to navigate the emotional challenges that will inevitably arise in a way that serves your Seven Slices.","","650.1","2021-11-10T22:58:27-08:00","2021-09-12T00:00:00-07:00","Work and family, Work-life balance","","57615198","9781260468908","9781260468908","ltid:208333228,isbn:9781260468908,google:TxYYEAAAQBAJ,amazon:B088P3LNRJ,goodreads:57615198,barnesnoble:w/the-work-life-balance-myth-david-mcneff/1136810901,oclc-owi:10209230266,oclc:1153644728,lc_authority_name:n2020059743,viaf_author_id:4160423058368032282,lccn:lccn-n2020059743","","HD4904.25","[The Work-Life Balance Myth: Rethinking Your Optimal Balance for Success](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333228)

Sometimes, we don't stare up from our screens and devices long enough to realize there is even another person on the other side of the tweet or email. ""Is anybody out there?"" One thing is for sure: this speed of life has taken a toll on our basic use of good manners and etiquette. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the decline of professional business communications. But manners and etiquette can be a powerful tool for business and sales success. It Begins with Please and Doesn't End with Thank You will show you how to regain those tools and techniques of bygone eras and update them for the digital today. This how-to guide and go-to resource takes the concepts of ""please"" and ""thank you"" into every realm where you engage with clients and prospects-from your first hellos and emails, phone and video calls, to conference rooms and restaurants. With his ""return to the personal"" philosophy, sales veteran Edwin P. Baldry breaks down the practices, principles, and protocols for successful business dealings and relationship-building. Via tips, tools, and humorous tales, Baldry shows how to tap into the often-overlooked power of manners to improve your business relationships, and how to transfer etiquette into sales performance.","","","2021-11-10T22:58:27-08:00","2021-10-18T00:00:00-07:00","","","59218933","9781632994608","9781632994608","isbn:9781632994608,amazon:B09GL3J4WZ,google:vRVDEAAAQBAJ,goodreads:59218933,ltid:208333181","","","[It Begins With Please and Doesn't End With Thank You: Transforming Business Etiquette Into Sales Performance](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333181)

And lately, being away at boarding school is only getting worse - Percy could have sworn his pre-algebra teacher turned into a monster and tried to kill him. When Percy's mom finds out, she knows it's time that he knew the truth about where he came from, and that he go to the one place he'll be safe. She sends Percy to Camp Half Blood, a summer camp for demigods (on Long Island), where he learns that the father he never knew is Poseidon, God of the Sea.

"","","Hardy, Benjamin","Benjamin Hardy","**Psychologist and motivational blogger Benjamin Hardy, PhD, shows you why self-transformation is easier to achieve than you think, at any stage of life.** If you have ever taken a test to identify your “personality type”, like the Myers-Briggs or Enneagram, you might be surprised to learn that such tests are not only unscientific, but are holding you back. The truth is, there’s no such thing as a personality “type”, or a “real you” that can only be unearthed through some process of self-discovery.  Instead, your personality is something you can intentionally choose and create. Rather than being defined by the past and trapped in unresolved traumas, you can build your identity and internal narrative to serve the future you desire. In *Personality Isn’t Permanent* , Dr. Hardy draws on psychological research to demolish the popular misconception that personality—a person's consistent attitudes and behaviors—is innate and unchanging. He offers practical, motivational advice to help you cultivate the traits and achieve the goals you always dreamed of.  In *Personality Isn't Permanent* , you'll learn:  · Why you should never be the ""former anything"". Defining yourself by your past successes can be just as damaging to your potential to grow as being haunted by past failures.   · How to flip the script on negative memories and view them as something that happened for you, not to you.    · How to design a desired vision of your “future self,” and make decisions based on what “they” would want.    · How to tap into what psychologists’ call “pull motivation” by narrowing your focus on a single, definable, and compelling outcome.    · Why you should consistently put yourself in new situations that can initially be emotionally uncomfortable.   · Why you should measure your progress by how much you've grown, rather than what you lack.  Along the way, you'll hear fascinating true stories of radical self-transformation, like Vanessa O’Brien, who quit her corporate job and went on to obtain Guinness World Records for climbing the tallest mountains in the world; Andre Norman, who became a Harvard fellow after serving a fourteen-year prison sentence; Ken Arlen, who instantly quit smoking by changing his backstory; and Hardy himself, who transcended his childhood in a broken home, surrounded by issues of addiction and mental illness, to get his PhD and build a happy family.  Filled with scientific strategies for reframing your past and designing your future, *Personality Isn't Permanent* is your practical guide to transcending your limitations and becoming the person you always wanted to be.","","155.2","2021-11-10T23:04:13-08:00","2021-10-21T00:00:00-07:00","Motivation (Psychology), Personality, Self-actualization (Psychology), Success--Psychological aspects","","52383212","9780593083314","9780593083314","ltid:208333174,barnesnoble:w/personality-isnt-permanent-benjamin-hardy/1130400670,isbn:9780593083314,goodreads:52383212,google:nobnDwAAQBAJ,oclc-owi:10043501037,oclc:1143801270,lc_authority_name:n2017068695,viaf_author_id:21151110795837062904,lccn:lccn-n2017068695","","BF698","[Personality Isn't Permanent: Break Free From Self-Limiting Beliefs and Rewrite Your Story](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333174)

So when Inez offers him $20,000 to run for city council, Tuffy gamely embarks on one of the most outlandish campaigns in political history, one that topples both his vision of the world and his place in it.

"","","Horrox, Rosemary","Rosemary Horrox","From 1348 to 1350 Europe was devastated by an epidemic that left between a third and one half of the population dead. This source book traces, through contemporary writings, the calamitous impact of the Black Death in Europe, with a particular emphasis on its spread across England from 1348 to 1349.  Rosemary Horrox surveys contemporary attempts to explain the plague, which was universally regarded as an expression of divine vengeance for the sins of humankind. Moralists all had their particular targets for criticism. However, this emphasis on divine chastisement did not preclude attempts to explain the plague in medical or scientific terms. Also, there was a widespread belief that human agencies had been involved, and such scapegoats as foreigners, the poor and Jews were all accused of poisoning wells. The final section of the book charts the social and psychological impact of the plague, and its effect on the late-medieval economy.","","614.494","2021-11-10T23:46:54-08:00","","Europe, Black Death, Medicine; Medieval","","1104806","9780719034985","9780719034985","ltid:208333901,isbn:9780719034985,google:1O_PX2wVD0sC,goodreads:1104806,oclc-owi:55793321,oclc:29798988,lc_authority_name:n84089755,viaf_author_id:110268666,isni:0000000108600033,lccn:lccn-n84089755","Horroxˏ Rosemary [Compiler; Translator; Editor; Other]","RC178.A1","[The Black Death](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333901)

The wind is lonely, and always looking for company.*   **   *And there are no strangers in the town of Near.* These are the truths that Lexi has heard all her life.  But when an actual stranger-a boy who seems to fade like smoke-appears outside her home on the moor at night, she knows that at least one of these sayings is no longer true.  The next night, the children of Near start disappearing from their beds, and the mysterious boy falls under suspicion. Still, he insists on helping Lexi search for them.

As the hunt for the children intensifies, so does Lexi's need to know-about the witch that just might be more than a bedtime story, about the wind that seems to speak through the walls at night, and about the history of this nameless boy.

"","","Chakraborty, S. A.","S. A. Chakraborty","NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY Library Journal | Vulture | The Verge | SYFYWireStep into The City of Brass, the spellbinding debut from S. A. Chakraborty, an imaginative alchemy of The Golem and the Jinni, The Grace of Kings, and Uprooted, in which the future of a magical Middle Eastern kingdom rests in the hands of a clever and defiant young con artist with miraculous healing gifts.Nahri has never believed in magic. Certainly, she has power; on the streets of eighteenth-century Cairo, she’s a con woman of unsurpassed talent. But she knows better than anyone that the trades she uses to get by—palm readings, zars, and a mysterious gift for healing—are all tricks, both the means to the delightful end of swindling Ottoman nobles and a reliable way to survive. But when Nahri accidentally summons Dara, an equally sly, darkly mysterious djinn warrior, to her side during one of her cons, she’s forced to reconsider her beliefs. For Dara tells Nahri an extraordinary tale: across hot, windswept sands teeming with creatures of fire and rivers where the mythical marid sleep, past ruins of once-magnificent human metropolises and mountains where the circling birds of prey are more than what they seem, lies Daevabad, the legendary city of brass—a city to which Nahri is irrevocably bound.In Daevabad, within gilded brass walls laced with enchantments and behind the six gates of the six djinn tribes, old resentments run deep. And when Nahri decides to enter this world, her arrival threatens to ignite a war that has been simmering for centuries. Spurning Dara’s warning of the treachery surrounding her, she embarks on a hesitant friendship with Alizayd, an idealistic prince who dreams of revolutionizing his father’s corrupt regime. All too soon, Nahri learns that true power is fierce and brutal. That magic cannot shield her from the dangerous web of court politics.

"","","Teerdhala, Swati","Swati Teerdhala","**A broken bond. A dying land. A cat-and-mouse game that can only end in bloodshed.** Esha is a legend, but no one knows. It’s only in the shadows that she moonlights as the Viper, the rebels’ highly skilled assassin. She’s devoted her life to avenging what she lost in the royal coup, and now she’s been tasked with her most important mission to date: taking down the ruthless General Hotha.  Kunal has been a soldier since childhood, training morning and night to uphold the power of King Vardaan. His uncle, the general, has ensured that Kunal never strays from the path—even as a part of Kunal longs to join the outside world, which has been growing only more volatile.  Then Esha’s and Kunal’s paths cross—and an unimaginable chain of events unfolds. Both the Viper and the soldier think they’re calling the shots, but they’re not the only players moving the pieces. As the bonds that hold their land in order break down and the sins of the past meet the promise of a new future, both rebel and soldier must make unforgivable choices.  Drawing inspiration from ancient Indian history and Hindu mythology, the first book in Swati Teerdhala's debut fantasy trilogy captivates with electric romance, stunning action, and the fierce bonds that hold people together—and drive them apart.","","813.6","2021-11-10T23:46:55-08:00","","Soldiers, Government; Resistance to, Insurgency","","38205303","9780062869210","9780062869210","google:2zPXuQEACAAJ,ltid:208333897,viaf_author_id:41155707077322411654,isni:0000000500254243,lccn:lccn-no2019056502,goodreads:38205303,lc_authority_name:no2019056502,ff:t/swati-teerdhala/tiger-at-midnight,oclc:1090100678,isbn:9780062869210,oclc-owi:5358357996","","PZ7.1.T437","[The Tiger at Midnight](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333897)

Her first choice, the dashing but reclusive doctor Augustine Lawrence, agrees to her proposal with only one condition: that she must never visit Lindridge Hall, his crumbling family manor outside of town.  Yet on their wedding night, an accident strands her at his door in a pitch-black rainstorm, and she finds him changed. Gone is the bold, courageous surgeon, and in his place is a terrified, paranoid man—one who cannot tell reality from nightmare, and fears Jane is an apparition, come to haunt him. By morning, Augustine is himself again, but Jane knows something is deeply wrong at Lindridge Hall, and with the man she has so hastily bound her safety to.  Set in a dark-mirror version of post-war England, Caitlin Starling crafts a new kind of gothic horror from the bones of the beloved canon. This *Crimson Peak* -inspired story assembles, then upends, every expectation set in place by Shirley Jackson and *Rebecca* , and will leave readers shaken, desperate to begin again as soon as they are finished.  “Don’t read this one alone at night; Caitlin Starling has done it again. Unsettling, atmospheric, and downright brutal at times, *The Death of Jane Lawrence* will continue to haunt you long after you leave Lindridge Hall…if the house lets you leave, that is.” —Genevieve Gornichec, author of *The Witch’s Heart*","","813.6","2021-11-10T23:46:55-08:00","","","","48915818","9781250272584","9781250272584","ff:s/caitlin-starling/death-of-jane-lawrence,isbn:9781250272584,google:cxQczgEACAAJ,ltid:208333884,goodreads:48915818,oclc-owi:11334615241,oclc:1255524894,lc_authority_name:no2019049575,viaf_author_id:45155564069813002379,lccn:lccn-no2019049575","","PS3619.T3747","[The Death of Jane Lawrence](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333884)

Her mother’s union with an outsider of a different race cast her once-proud family into disgrace, so Immanuelle does her best to worship the Father, follow Holy Protocol, and lead a life of submission, devotion, and absolute conformity, like all the other women in the settlement.  But a mishap lures her into the forbidden Darkwood surrounding Bethel, where the first prophet once chased and killed four powerful witches. Their spirits are still lurking there, and they bestow a gift on Immanuelle: the journal of her dead mother, who Immanuelle is shocked to learn once sought sanctuary in the wood.  Fascinated by the secrets in the diary, Immanuelle finds herself struggling to understand how her mother could have consorted with the witches. But when she begins to learn grim truths about the Church and its history, she realizes the true threat to Bethel is its own darkness. And she starts to understand that if Bethel is to change, it must begin with her.","","813.6","2021-11-10T23:46:55-08:00","","Mothers and daughters, Puritans, Witches, Family secrets, Orphans, Prophets, Secrecy, Witch hunting","","49789629","9780593099605","9780593099605","goodreads:49789629,google:5_LsDwAAQBAJ,ff:h/alexis-henderson/year-of-the-witching,ltid:208333957,isbn:9780593099605,oclc-owi:9609099465,oclc:1122877087,lc_authority_name:n2019065982,viaf_author_id:40157340765509922800,isni:000000049622573,lccn:lccn-n2019065982","","","[The Year of the Witching](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333957)

A blood feud between two gangs runs the streets red, leaving the city helpless in the grip of chaos. At the heart of it all is eighteen-year-old Juliette Cai, a former flapper who has returned to assume her role as the proud heir of the Scarlet Gang—a network of criminals far above the law. Their only rivals in power are the White Flowers, who have fought the Scarlets for generations. And behind every move is their heir, Roma Montagov, Juliette’s first love…and first betrayal.  But when gangsters on both sides show signs of instability culminating in clawing their own throats out, the people start to whisper. Of a contagion, a madness. Of a monster in the shadows. As the deaths stack up, Juliette and Roma must set their guns—and grudges—aside and work together, for if they can’t stop this mayhem, then there will be no city left for either to rule.","","813.6","2021-11-10T23:46:55-08:00","","China--Shanghai, China, Monsters, Death, Gangs, Young adult fiction, Historical fiction","","50892212","9781534457690","9781534457690","ff:g/chloe-gong/these-violent-delights,lccn:lccn-n2020002880,lc_authority_name:n2020002880,isbn:9781534457690,oclc:1137178186,oclc-owi:10547524143,viaf_author_id:7157949167465090685,goodreads:50892212,google:8DkEEAAAQBAJ,ltid:208333894","","PS3607.O525","[These Violent Delights](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333894)

Schwab, #1 *New York Times* bestselling author).** The Montoyas are used to a life without explanations. They know better than to ask why the pantry never seems to run low, or why their matriarch won’t ever leave their home in Four Rivers—not for graduations, weddings, or baptisms. But when Orquídea Divina invites them to her funeral and to collect their inheritance, they hope to learn the secrets that she has held onto so tightly their whole lives. Instead, Orquídea is transformed into a ceiba tree, leaving them with more questions than answers.  Seven years later, her gifts have manifested in different ways for Marimar, Rey, and Rhiannon, granting them unexpected blessings and powers. But soon, a hidden figure begins to tear through their family tree, picking them off one by one as it seeks to destroy Orquídea’s line. Determined to save what’s left of their family and uncover the truth behind their inheritance, her descendants travel to Ecuador—to the place where Orquídea buried her secrets and broken promises and never looked back.  Alternating between Orquídea’s past and her descendants’ present, *The Inheritance of Orquídea Divina* is a “spellbinding tale, both timeless and fresh, that will stay with you long after you’ve turned the last page. Prepare to fall in love” (Kim Liggett, *New York Times* bestselling author).","","","2021-11-10T23:46:55-08:00","","","","58730741","1432893807","1432893807","isbn:1432893807,ff:c/zoraida-cordova/inheritance-of-orquidea-divina,goodreads:58730741","","","[1432893807](https://www.librarything.com/addbooks?search=1432893807)

But the Grand Season has just begun, and already Nina’s debut has gone disastrously awry. She has always struggled to control her telekinesis—neighbors call her the Witch of Oldhouse—and the haphazard manifestations of her powers make her the subject of malicious gossip.  When entertainer Hector Auvray arrives to town, Nina is dazzled. A telekinetic like her, he has traveled the world performing his talents for admiring audiences. He sees Nina not as a witch, but ripe with potential to master her power under his tutelage. With Hector’s help, Nina’s talent blossoms, as does her love for him.  But great romances are for fairytales, and Hector is hiding a truth from Nina — and himself—that threatens to end their courtship before it truly begins.  *The Beautiful Ones* is a charming tale of love and betrayal, and the struggle between conformity and passion, set in a world where scandal is a razor-sharp weapon.

"","","Tudor, C. J.","C. J. Tudor","The thrilling second novel from the author of The Chalk Man, about a teacher with a hidden agenda who returns to settle scores at a school he once attended, only to uncover a darker secret than he could have imagined.  Joe never wanted to come back to Arnhill. After the way things ended with his old gang--the betrayal, the suicide, the murder--and after what happened when his sister went missing, the last thing he wanted to do was return to his hometown. But Joe doesn't have a choice. Because judging by what was done to that poor Morton kid, what happened all those years ago to Joe's sister is happening again. And only Joe knows who is really at fault.  Lying his way into a teaching job at his former high school is the easy part. Facing off with former friends who are none too happy to have him back in town--while avoiding the enemies he's made in the years since--is tougher. But the hardest part of all will be returning to that abandoned mine where it all went wrong and his life changed forever, and finally confronting the shocking, horrifying truth about Arnhill, his sister, and himself. Because for Joe, the worst moment of his life wasn't the day his sister went missing.  It was the day she came back.  With the same virtuosic command of character and pacing she displayed in The Chalk Man, C. J. Tudor has once again crafted an extraordinary novel that brilliantly blends harrowing psychological suspense, a devilishly puzzling mystery, and enough shocks and thrills to satisfy even the most seasoned reader.","","823.92","2021-11-10T23:46:55-08:00","","Homecoming, Brothers and sisters, Secrecy, Teachers, England, Murder, Revenge, Abandoned mines","","40490762","9781524761011","9781524761011","isbn:9781524761011,goodreads:40490762,ltid:208333942,ff:t/c-j-tudor/taking-of-annie-thorne,lc_authority_name:n2017018357,viaf_author_id:93152682495023310240,isni:0000000464397799,lccn:lccn-n2017018357,oclc-owi:5527045776,oclc:1111640482","","PR6120.U36","[The Taking of Annie Thorne](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333942)

The phantoms of her old life keep haunting her, but a move with her newly blended family from their small California beach town to the embattled Midwestern city of Cedarville might be the fresh start she needs. Her mom has accepted a new job with the Sterling Foundation that comes with a free house, one that Mari now has to share with her bratty ten-year-old stepsister, Piper.  The renovated picture-perfect home on Maple Street, sitting between dilapidated houses, surrounded by wary neighbors has its . . . secrets. That’s only half the problem: household items vanish, doors open on their own, lights turn off, shadows walk past rooms, voices can be heard in the walls, and there’s a foul smell seeping through the vents only Mari seems to notice. Worse: Piper keeps talking about a friend who wants Mari gone.  But “running from ghosts” is just a metaphor, right?  As the house closes in, Mari learns that the danger isn’t limited to Maple Street. Cedarville has its secrets, too.

WINNER OF THE ABIA BOOK OF THE YEAR 2021Over the last decade, we have become better at knowing what brings us contentment, well-being and joy. We know, for example, that there are a few core truths to the science of happiness. We know that being kind and altruistic makes us happy, that turning off devices, talking to people, forging relationships, living with meaning and delving into the concerns of others offer our best chance of achieving happiness. But how do we retain happiness? It often slips out of our hands as quickly as we find it. So, when we are exposed to, or learn, good things, how do we continue to burn with them?And more than that, when our world goes dark, when we're overwhelmed by illness or heartbreak, loss or pain, how do we survive, stay alive or even bloom? In the muck and grit of a daily existence full of disappointments and a disturbing lack of control over many of the things that matter most – finite relationships, fragile health, fraying economies, a planet in peril – how do we find, nurture and carry our own inner, living light – a light to ward off the darkness?

"","","Gray, Ayana","Ayana Gray","""Rich in magic and mythos, Beasts of Prey is a feast for all the senses."" --Renée Ahdieh, New York Times bestselling author of The Beautiful ""The hunt for your next YA fantasy book trilogy obsession has ended."" --Entertainment Weekly In this blockbuster fantasy series, perfect for fans of Holly Black and Tomi Adeyemi, fate binds two Black teenagers together as they journey into a magical jungle to hunt down the vicious monster who is threatening their home. But as they begin to uncover ancient deadly secrets, it quickly becomes unclear whether they are the hunters...or the hunted. There's no such thing as magic in the broken city of Lkossa, especially for sixteen-year-old Koffi, who holds a power within her that could only be described as magic--a power that if discovered could cost her life. Indentured to the notorious Night Zoo, Koffi knows the fearsome creatures in her care and paying off her family's debts to secure their eventual freedom can be her only focus. But the night those she loves are gravely threatened by the Zoo's cruel master, Koffi finally unleashes the power she doesn't fully understand, upending her life completely.  As the second son of a decorated hero, Ekon is all but destined to become a Son of the Six--an elite warrior--and uphold a family legacy. But on the night of his final rite of passage, Ekon encounters not only the Shetani--a vicious monster that has plagued the city for nearly a century and stalks his nightmares, but Koffi who seems to have the power to ward off the beast. Koffi's power ultimately saves Ekon's life, but his choice to let her flee dooms his hopes of becoming a warrior.  Desperate to redeem himself, Ekon vows to hunt the Shetani and end its reign of terror, but he can't do it alone. Meanwhile, Koffi believes finding the Shetani could also be the key to solving her own problems. Koffi and Ekon form a tentative alliance and together enter the Greater Jungle, a world steeped in wild, frightening magic and untold dangers. The hunt begins. But it quickly becomes unclear whether they are the hunters or the hunted.","","FIC","2021-11-10T23:46:55-08:00","","","","56552953","9780593405680","9780593405680","google:LAhAEAAAQBAJ,ltid:208333924,ff:g/ayana-gray/beasts-of-prey,goodreads:56552953,isbn:9780593405680,oclc-owi:10910716037,oclc:1229028609,lc_authority_name:n2021028556,viaf_author_id:5162236715713541675,lccn:lccn-n2021028556","","PZ7.1.G7326","[Beasts of Prey](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333924)

We've got our eye on this stylish blockbuster."" --Entertainment Weekly Project Runway meets Mulan in this sweeping fantasy about a young girl who poses as a boy to compete for the role of imperial tailor and embarks on an impossible journey to sew three magic dresses from the sun, the moon, and the stars. Maia Tamarin dreams of becoming the greatest tailor in the land, but as a girl, the best she can hope for is to marry well. When a royal messenger summons her ailing father, once a tailor of renown, to court, Maia poses as a boy and takes his place. She knows her life is forfeit if her secret is discovered, but she'll take that risk to achieve her dream and save her family from ruin. There's just one catch: Maia is one of twelve tailors vying for the job. Backstabbing and lies run rampant as the tailors compete in challenges to prove their artistry and skill. Maia's task is further complicated when she draws the attention of the court magician, Edan, whose piercing eyes seem to see straight through her disguise. And nothing can prepare her for the final challenge: to sew three magic gowns for the emperor's reluctant bride-to-be, from the laughter of the sun, the tears of the moon, and the blood of stars. With this impossible task before her, she embarks on a journey to the far reaches of the kingdom, seeking the sun, the moon, and the stars and finding more than she ever could have imagined.

Her best friend is the beautiful and endlessly self-possessed Bobbi. At a local poetry performance one night, they meet a well-known photographer, and as the girls are then gradually drawn into her world, Frances is reluctantly impressed by the older woman's sophisticated home and handsome husband, Nick. But however amusing Frances and Nick's flirtation seems at first, it begins to give way to a strange--and then painful--intimacy. Written with gemlike precision and marked by a sly sense of humor, Conversations with Friends is wonderfully alive to the pleasures and dangers of youth, and the messy edges of female friendship.

Nevertheless, she dreams of a life far from her dusty small town in southern Mexico. A life she can call her own.  Yet this new life seems as distant as the stars, until the day she finds a curious wooden box in her grandfather’s room. She opens it—and accidentally frees the spirit of the Mayan god of death, who requests her help in recovering his throne from his treacherous brother. Failure will mean Casiopea’s demise, but success could make her dreams come true. In the company of the strangely alluring god and armed with her wits, Casiopea begins an adventure that will take her on a cross-country odyssey from the jungles of Yucatán to the bright lights of Mexico City—and deep into the darkness of the Mayan underworld.Praise for Gods of Jade and Shadow“A dark, dazzling fairy tale . . . a whirlwind tour of a 1920s Mexico vivid with jazz, the memories of revolution, and gods, demons, and magic.”—NPR“Snappy dialog, stellar worldbuilding, lyrical prose, and a slow-burn romance make this a standout. . . .

(Carmen Maria Machado)  ""Um, holy shit...This novel will be the most fun you'll have this summer."" —Emily Temple, Literary Hub**Remy and Alicia, a couple of insecure service workers, are not particularly happy together. But they are bound by a shared obsession with Jen, a beautiful former co-worker of Remy’s who now seems to be following her bliss as a globe-trotting jewelry designer. In and outside the bedroom, Remy and Alicia's entire relationship revolves around fantasies of Jen, whose every Instagram caption, outfit, and new age mantra they know by heart.  Imagine their confused excitement when they run into Jen, in the flesh, and she invites them on a surfing trip to the Hamptons with her wealthy boyfriend and their group. Once there, Remy and Alicia try (a little too hard) to fit into Jen’s exalted social circle, but violent desire and class resentment bubble beneath the surface of this beachside paradise, threatening to erupt. As small disturbances escalate into outright horror, we find ourselves tumbling with Remy and Alicia into an uncanny alternate reality, one shaped by their most unspeakable, deviant, and intoxicating fantasies. Is this what “self-actualization” looks like?  Part millennial social comedy, part psychedelic horror, and all wildly entertaining, *A Touch of Jen* is a sly, unflinching examination of the hidden drives that lurk just outside the frame of our carefully curated selves.","","813.6","2021-11-10T23:46:55-08:00","","","","55867897","9780316704267","9780316704267","isbn:9780316704267,ltid:208333971,goodreads:55867897,google:iIoIzgEACAAJ,ff:m/beth-morgan/touch-of-jen,oclc-owi:10621587241,oclc:1258120512,lc_authority_name:n96065437,viaf_author_id:33724954,isni:0000000035537175,lccn:lccn-n96065437","","PS2613.O7265","[A Touch of Jen](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333971)

Every night, before she puts them to bed, she whispers to them: “You are good, you are kind, you are clever, you are funny.” She’s determined that they never doubt for a minute that their mother loves them unconditionally. After all, her own mother Jeanie had died when she was only seven years old and Faye has never gotten over that intense pain of losing her.  But one day, her life is turned upside down when she finds herself in 1977, the year before her mother died. Suddenly, she has the chance to reconnect with her long-lost mother, and even meets her own younger self, a little girl she can barely remember. Jeanie doesn’t recognize Faye as her daughter, of course, even though there is something eerily familiar about her...  As the two women become close friends, they share many secrets—but Faye is terrified of revealing the truth about her identity. Will it prevent her from returning to her own time and her beloved husband and daughters? What if she’s doomed to remain in the past forever? Faye knows that eventually she will have to choose between those she loves in the past and those she loves in the here and now, and that knowledge presents her with an impossible choice.

"","","Rogerson, Margaret","Margaret Rogerson","From the New York Times bestselling author of Sorcery of Thorns and An Enchantment of Ravens comes a thrilling new YA fantasy about a teen girl with mythic abilities who must defend her world against restless spirits of the dead.The dead of Loraille do not rest. Artemisia is training to be a Gray Sister, a nun who cleanses the bodies of the deceased so that their souls can pass on; otherwise, they will rise as spirits with a ravenous hunger for the living. She would rather deal with the dead than the living, who trade whispers about her scarred hands and troubled past. When her convent is attacked by possessed soldiers, Artemisia defends it by awakening an ancient spirit bound to a saint’s relic. It is a revenant, a malevolent being that threatens to possess her the moment she drops her guard. Wielding its extraordinary power almost consumes her—but death has come to Loraille, and only a vespertine, a priestess trained to wield a high relic, has any chance of stopping it. With all knowledge of vespertines lost to time, Artemisia turns to the last remaining expert for help: the revenant itself. As she unravels a sinister mystery of saints, secrets, and dark magic, her bond with the revenant grows. And when a hidden evil begins to surface, she discovers that facing this enemy might require her to betray everything she has been taught to believe—if the revenant doesn’t betray her first.","","FIC","2021-11-10T23:46:55-08:00","","Magic","","56980403","9781534477117","9781534477117","goodreads:56980403,ff:r/margaret-rogerson/vespertine,google:op1BEAAAQBAJ,isbn:9781534477117,ltid:208333998,oclc-owi:11014759469,oclc:1237346405,lc_authority_name:no2017122859,viaf_author_id:12605741,isni:000000011838627,lccn:lccn-no2017122859","","PZ7.1.R6635","[Vespertine](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333998)

Even if the most obvious suspect was your father?  This is the dilemma facing the four grown Delaney siblings.  The Delaneys are fixtures in their community. The parents, Stan and Joy, are the envy of all of their friends. They’re killers on the tennis court, and off it their chemistry is palpable. But after fifty years of marriage, they’ve finally sold their famed tennis academy and are ready to start what should be the golden years of their lives. So why are Stan and Joy so miserable?  The four Delaney children—Amy, Logan, Troy, and Brooke—were tennis stars in their own right, yet as their father will tell you, none of them had what it took to go all the way. But that’s okay, now that they’re all successful grown-ups and there is the wonderful possibility of grandchildren on the horizon.  One night a stranger named Savannah knocks on Stan and Joy’s door, bleeding after a fight with her boyfriend. The Delaneys are more than happy to give her the small kindness she sorely needs. If only that was all she wanted.  Later, when Joy goes missing, and Savannah is nowhere to be found, the police question the one person who remains: Stan. But for someone who claims to be innocent, he, like many spouses, seems to have a lot to hide. Two of the Delaney children think their father is innocent, two are not so sure—but as the two sides square off against each other in perhaps their biggest match ever, all of the Delaneys will start to reexamine their shared family history in a very new light.","","823.92","2021-11-10T23:46:55-08:00","","","","56143578","9781250220257","9781250220257","goodreads:56143578,ltid:208333954,isbn:9781250220257,google:wpURzgEACAAJ,ff:m/liane-moriarty/apples-never-fall,oclc-owi:10968176236,oclc:1233155122,lc_authority_name:n2003056396,viaf_author_id:90781430,isni:0000000064675243,lccn:lccn-n2003056396","","PR9619.4.M67","[Apples Never Fall](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333954)

A careful creature of routine and decorum, she lives a precariously controlled existence on the Upper East Side until one morning, when the shopkeeper of her favorite patisserie suggests that her husband's latest protagonist--a detestable character named Johanna--is based on Mrs. March herself. Clutching her ostrich leather pocketbook and mint-colored gloves, she flees the shop. What could have merited this humiliation?That one casual remark robs Mrs. March of the belief that she knew everything about her husband--and herself--thus sending her on an increasingly paranoid journey that begins within the pages of a book. While snooping in George's office, Mrs. March finds a newspaper clipping about a missing woman. Did George have anything to do with her disappearance? He's been going on a lot of ""hunting trips"" up north with his editor lately, leaving Mrs. March all alone at night with her tormented thoughts, and the cockroaches that have suddenly started to appear, and strange breathing noises . . . As she begins to decode her husband's secrets, her deafening anxiety and fierce determination threaten everyone in her wake--including her stoic housekeeper, Martha, and her unobtrusive son, Jonathan, whom she loves so profoundly, when she remembers to love him at all. Combining a Hitchcockian sensibility with wickedly dark humor, Virginia Feito, a brilliantly talented and, at times, mischievous newcomer, offers a razor-sharp exploration of the fragility of identity. A mesmerizing novel of psychological suspense and casebook insecurity turned full-blown neurosis, Mrs. March will have you second-guessing your own seemingly familiar reflection in the mirror.","","823.92","2021-11-10T23:46:55-08:00","","Marriage, Gossip","","55298324","9781631498619","9781631498619","goodreads:55298324,isbn:9781631498619,google:Q5LYzQEACAAJ,ltid:208333898,ff:f/virginia-feito/mrs-march,oclc-owi:10466799237,oclc:1190814818,lc_authority_name:n2021002452,viaf_author_id:17161096636729102143,lccn:lccn-n2021002452","","PR9155.9.F45","[Mrs. March](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333898)

"","","Yoder, Rachel","Rachel Yoder","**""[ *Nightbitch* ] feels like reading a deliciously long text from your smartest friend, with a hint of Kafka, if Kafka lived in the age of mommy bloggers . . . Yoder writes about contemporary anxieties with so much intelligence and charm that she can cause you to reflect without spiraling into deep depression. That’s a feat, these days, greater than metamorphosis.""— *Glamour* ** **   * *In this blazingly smart and voracious debut, an artist turned stay-at-home mom becomes convinced she's turning into a dog.*** *  *One day, the mother was a mother, but then one night, she was quite suddenly something else...* An ambitious mother puts her art career on hold to stay at home with her newborn son, but the experience does not match her imagination. Two years later, she steps into the bathroom for a break from her toddler's demands, only to discover a dense patch of hair on the back of her neck. In the mirror, her canines suddenly look sharper than she remembers. Her husband, who travels for work five days a week, casually dismisses her fears from faraway hotel rooms.  As the mother's symptoms intensify, and her temptation to give in to her new dog impulses peak, she struggles to keep her alter-canine-identity secret. Seeking a cure at the library, she discovers the mysterious academic tome which becomes her bible, *A Field Guide to Magical Women: A Mythical Ethnography* , and meets a group of mommies involved in a multilevel-marketing scheme who may also be more than what they seem.  An outrageously original novel of ideas about art, power, and womanhood wrapped in a satirical fairy tale, *Nightbitch* will make you want to howl in laughter and recognition. And you should. You should howl as much as you want.","","813.6","2021-11-10T23:46:55-08:00","","","","55835474","9780385546812","9780385546812","isbn:9780385546812,goodreads:55835474,ltid:208333964,ff:y/rachel-yoder/nightbitch,google:nvf8zQEACAAJ,oclc-owi:10529696576,oclc:1196085785,lc_authority_name:no2020110955,viaf_author_id:11160120841440442385,lccn:lccn-no2020110955","Yoderˏ Rachel : 1978-","PS3625.O3385","[Nightbitch](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333964)

"","","Winstead, Ashley","Ashley Winstead","One college reunion. One unsolved murder. Ten years after graduation, Jessica Miller has planned her triumphant return to her southern, elite Duquette University, down to the envious whispers that are sure to follow in her wake. Everyone is going to see the girl she wants them to see -- confident, beautiful, indifferent. Not the girl she was when she left campus, back when Heather Shelby's murder fractured everything, including the tight bond linking the six friends she'd been closest to since freshman year. But not everyone is ready to move on. Not everyone left Duquette ten years ago, and not everyone can let Heather's murder go unsolved. Someone is determined to trap the real killer, to make the guilty pay. When the six friends are reunited, they will be forced to confront what happened that night-and the years' worth of secrets each of them would do anything to keep hidden. Told in racing dual timelines, with a dark campus setting and a darker look at friendship, love, obsession, and ambition, In My Dreams I Hold A Knife is an addictive, propulsive read you won't be able to put down.

She is certainly a strange sight for leering British audiences always eager for the spectacle of *colonial curiosity*. But Iris also has a secret that even “strange” doesn’t capture…​  She cannot die.  Haunted by her unnatural power and with no memories of her past, Iris is obsessed with discovering who she is. But that mission gets more complicated when she meets the dark and alluring Adam Temple, a member of a mysterious order called the Enlightenment Committee. Adam seems to know much more about her than he lets on, and he shares with her a terrifying revelation: the world is ending, and the Committee will decide who lives…and who doesn’t.  To help them choose a leader for the upcoming apocalypse, the Committee is holding the Tournament of Freaks, a macabre competition made up of vicious fighters with fantastical abilities. Adam wants Iris to be his champion, and in return he promises her the one thing she wants most: the truth about who she really is.  If Iris wants to learn about her shadowy past, she has no choice but to fight. But the further she gets in the grisly tournament, the more she begins to remember—and the more she wonders if the truth is something best left forgotten.","","FIC","2021-11-10T23:46:55-08:00","","","","43699470","1534453563","1534453563","google:DcA8EAAAQBAJ,isbn:1534453563,barnesnoble:w/the-bones-of-ruin-sarah-raughley/1138779218,ff:r/sarah-raughley/bones-of-ruin,ltid:208333970,goodreads:43699470,oclc-owi:10887374638,oclc:1227790219,lc_authority_name:nb2015000026,viaf_author_id:313289911,isni:0000000444359314,lccn:lccn-nb2015000026","","PZ7.1.R38","[The Bones of Ruin](https://www.librarything.com/work/book/208333970)
